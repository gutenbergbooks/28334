<p>Transcriber's Note:</p>

<p>Two types of notes appear in the original book: text variants,
printed immediately below the text on each page, and editor's notes, printed at the bottom of each page;
both types reference the text by line number. In this HTML version, all of the notes
are collected together towards the end, before the index, and instead of referencing line numbers,
they are numbered sequentially.  There are separate sequences for notes to the Introduction and to each
of the five Acts. Anchors in the text are hyperlinked.
In some cases, the original references to text line numbers have been preserved.</p>

<p>A list of the abbreviations used in the notes for cited editions can be found on
<a href="#Authorities_With_Abbreviations">page lv</a>.</p>

<p>As in the original, throughout the text C&aelig;sar is spelled with the ligature &aelig;,
except for one instance: "composition of _Julius Caesar_".</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>The text of this edition of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is based upon a
collation of the seventeenth century Folios, the Globe edition,
and that of Delius. As compared with the text of the
earlier editions of Hudson's Shakespeare, it is conservative.
Exclusive of changes in spelling, punctuation, and stage
directions, very few emendations by eighteenth century and
nineteenth century editors have been adopted; and these,
with every variation from the First Folio, are indicated in the
textual notes. These notes are printed immediately below
the text so that a reader or student may see at a glance the
evidence in the case of a disputed reading and have some
definite understanding of the reasons for those differences in
the text of Shakespeare which frequently surprise and very
often annoy. A consideration of the more poetical, or the
more dramatically effective, of two variant readings will often
lead to rich results in awakening a spirit of discriminating
interpretation and in developing true creative criticism. In
no sense is this a textual variorum edition. The variants
given are only those of importance and high authority.</p>

<p>The spelling and the punctuation of the text are modern,
except in the case of verb terminations in <i>-ed</i>, which,
when the <i>e</i> is silent, are printed with the apostrophe in its
place. This is the general usage in the First Folio. Modern

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>

spelling has to a certain extent been followed in the
text variants; but the original spelling has been retained
wherever its peculiarities have been the basis for important
textual criticism and emendation.</p>

<p>With the exception of the position of the textual variants,
the plan of this edition is similar to that of the old
Hudson Shakespeare. It is impossible to specify the various
instances of revision and rearrangement in the matter
of the Introduction and the interpretative notes, but the
endeavor has been to retain all that gave the old edition
its unique place and to add the results of what seems vital
and permanent in later inquiry and research.</p>

<p>While it is important that the principle of <i>suum cuique</i>
be attended to so far as is possible in matters of research
and scholarship, it is becoming more and more difficult to
give every man his own in Shakespearian annotation. The
amount of material accumulated is so great that the identity-origin
of much important comment and suggestion is
either wholly lost or so crushed out of shape as to be beyond
recognition. Instructive significance perhaps attaches to
this in editing the works of one who quietly made so much
of materials gathered by others. But the list of authorities
given on page li will indicate the chief source of much
that has gone to enrich the value of this edition. Professor
W.P. Trent, of Columbia University, has offered
valuable suggestions and given important advice; and to
Mr. M. Grant Daniell's patience, accuracy, and judgment
this volume owes both its freedom from many a blunder
and its possession of a carefully arranged index.</p>

profound impression upon the popular imagination than
the assassination of Julius C&aelig;sar. Apart from its overwhelming
interest as a personal catastrophe, it was regarded
in the sixteenth century as a happening of the
greatest historical moment, fraught with significant public
lessons for all time. There is ample evidence that in
England from the beginning of Elizabeth's reign it was
the subject of much literary and dramatic treatment, and
in making the murder of "the mightiest Julius" the climax
of a play, Shakespeare was true to that instinct which
drew him for material to themes of universal and eternal
interest.</p>

THE LIVES
OF THE NOBLE GRECIANS
AND ROMANES, COMPARED

Translated out of Greeke into French by IAMES AMIOT, Abbot of Bellozane,

-->

<p>This interesting
title-page gives in brief the literary history of North's
translation, which was made not directly from the original
Greek of Plutarch, but from a French version by Jacques
Amyot, bishop of Auxerre.<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_2" id="tagIntro_2"
href="#noteIntro_2">[2]</a> In 1603 appeared a third
edition with additional <i>Lives</i> and new matter on the title-page.<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_3" id="tagIntro_3"
href="#noteIntro_3">[3]</a>
There were subsequent editions in 1612,<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_4" id="tagIntro_4"
href="#noteIntro_4">[4]</a> 1631,
1656, and 1676. The popularity of this work attested by
these reprintings was thoroughly deserved, for North's Plutarch
is among the richest and freshest monuments of Elizabethan
prose literature, and, apart altogether from the use
made of it by Shakespeare, is in itself an invaluable repertory
of honest, manly, idiomatic English. No abstract of
the Plutarchian matter need be given here, as all the more
important passages drawn upon for the play are quoted in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>

the footnotes to the text. These will show that in most of
the leading incidents the great Greek biographer is closely
followed, though in many cases these incidents are worked
out and developed with rare fertility of invention and art.
It is very significant that in the second half of <i>The Life
of Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, which Shakespeare draws upon very heavily,
Plutarch emphasizes those weaknesses of C&aelig;sar which
are made so prominent in the play. Besides this, in many
places the Plutarchian form and order of thought, and also
the very words of North's racy and delectable English are
retained, with such an embalming for immortality as Shakespeare
alone could give.<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_5" id="tagIntro_5"
href="#noteIntro_5">[5]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> Shakespeare's indebtedness to North's
Plutarch may be summed up as extending to (1) the general
story of the play; (2) minor incidents and happenings, as
C&aelig;sar's falling-sickness, the omens before his death, and
the writings thrown in Brutus's way; (3) touches of detail,
as in the description of Cassius's "lean and hungry look"
and of Antony's tastes and personal habits; and (4) noteworthy
expressions, phrases, and single words, as in <a href="#tagIII_152">III, ii,
240-241</a>, <a href="#tagIII_2_246">246-248</a>; <a href="#tagIV_48">IV, iii, 2</a>; <a href="#tagIV_3_178">IV, iii, 178</a>; <a href="#tagV_36">V, i, 80-81</a>;
<a href="#tagV_3_109">V, iii, 109.</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Shakespeare's alteration of Plutarchian
material is along the lines of (1) idealization, as
in the characters of Brutus and Cassius; (2) amplification,
as in the use Antony makes of C&aelig;sar's rent and
bloody mantle; and (3) simplification and compression
of the action for dramatic effect, as in making C&aelig;sar's
triumph take place at the time of "the feast of Lupercal,"
in the treatment of the quarrel between Brutus and Cassius,
which in Plutarch lasts for two days, and in making
the two battles of Philippi occur on the same day. See

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span></p>

<p>In this translation of Appian the events before and after
C&aelig;sar's death are described minutely and with many graphic
touches. Compare, for example, with the quotation from
Plutarch given in the <a href="#noteII_148">note, p. 68, l. 33</a>, this account of the
same incident in Appian: "The day before that C&aelig;sar
should go to the senate, he had him at a banquet with
Lepidus ... and talking merrily what death was best for
a man, some saying one and some another, he of all praised
sudden death." Here are some of the marginal summaries
in Appian: "C&aelig;sar refuseth the name of King," "A crown
upon C&aelig;sar's image by one that was apprehended of the
tribunes Marullus and Sitius," "C&aelig;sar hath the Falling-Sickness,"
"C&aelig;sar's Wife (hath) a fearful Dream," "C&aelig;sar
contemneth sacrifices of evil Luck," "C&aelig;sar giveth over
when Brutus had stricken him," "The fear of the Conspirators,"
"The bad Angel of Brutus."</p>

<p>What gives interest and distinction to Appian's translation
as a probable source for material in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is
that in it we have speeches by Antony, Brutus, and Lepidus
at the time of the reading of C&aelig;sar's will. In this translation
Antony's first speech begins, "They that would have

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>

voices tried upon C&aelig;sar must know afore that if he ruled
as an officer lawfully chosen, then all his acts and decrees
must stand in force...." On Antony's second speech the
comment is, "Thus wrought Antony artificially." His speech
to the Senate begins, "Silence being commanded, he said
thus, 'Of the citizens offenders (you men of equal honour)
in this your consultation I have said nothing....'" The
speech of Lepidus to the people has this setting: "When
he was come to the place of speech he lamented, weeping,
and thus said, 'Here I was yesterday with C&aelig;sar, and now
am I here to inquire of C&aelig;sar's death.... C&aelig;sar is
gone from us, an holy and honourable man in deed.'" The
effect of this speech is commented on as follows: "Handling
the matter thus craftily, the hired men, knowing that
he was ambitious, praised him and exhorted him to take
the office of C&aelig;sar's priesthood." A long speech by Brutus
follows the reading of C&aelig;sar's will. It begins: "Now, O
citizens, we be here with you that yesterday were in the
common court not as men fleeing to the temple that have
done amiss, nor as to a fort, having committed all we have
to you.... We have heard what hath been objected
against us of our enemies, touching the oath and touching
cause of doubt...." The effect of this speech is thus
described: "Whiles Brutus thus spake, all the hearers considering
with themselves that he spake nothing but right,
did like them well, and as men of courage and lovers of the
people, had them in great admiration and were turned into
their favour."</p>

<p><a name="Earlier_Plays" id="Earlier_Plays">3. <i>Earlier Plays.</i></a> As already mentioned, England had
plays on the subject of Julius C&aelig;sar from the first years
of Elizabeth's reign. As not one of these earlier plays is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>

extant, there can be no certainty as to whether Shakespeare
drew upon them for materials or inspiration, but, as
Professor Herford says, "he seems to be cognisant of their
existence." His opening scene is addressed to a public
familiar with the history of Pompey and Pompey's sons.
Among these earlier plays was one almost contemporary
with the first production of <i>Gorboduc</i>, the first English
tragedy. It is referred to under the name of <i>Julyus Sesar</i>
in an entry in Machyn's <i>Diary</i> under February 1, 1562.
In <i>Plays confuted in five Actions</i>, printed probably in
1582, Stephen Gosson mentions the history of <i>C&aelig;sar and
Pompey</i> as a contemporary play. A Latin play on C&aelig;sar's
death was acted at Oxford in 1582, and for it Dr. Richard
Eedes (Eades, Edes) of Christ Church wrote the epilogue
(<i>Epilogus C&aelig;saris Intersecti</i>). In Henslowe's <i>Diary</i> under
November 8, 1594, a <i>Seser and pompie</i> is mentioned as a
new play. Mr. A. W. Verity (<i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, The Pitt Press
edition) makes the interesting suggestion that in <a href="#tagIII_1_111">III, i,
111-116</a>, there may be an allusion to these earlier plays.
Cf. also <i>Hamlet</i>, III, ii, 107-111, quoted below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="The_Scene_Of_The_Assassination" id="The_Scene_Of_The_Assassination"><span class="smallcaps">The Scene of the Assassination</span></a></h5>

<p>In transferring the assassination of C&aelig;sar from the <i>Porticus
Pompeia</i> ("Pompey's porch," <a href="#tagI_244">I, iii, 126</a>) to the Capitol,
Shakespeare departed from Plutarch and historical accuracy
to follow a popular tradition that had received the signal
imprimatur of Chaucer:</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p>This Iulius to the Capitolie wente</p>
<p>Upon a day, as he was wont to goon,<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_6" id="tagIntro_6"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>

<p>And in the Capitolie anon him hente<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_7" id="tagIntro_7"

<p>With many a wounde, and thus they lete him lye;</p>

</div>
<p class="right"><i>The Monkes Tale</i>, ll. 715-718. (Skeat's <i>Chaucer</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p>This literary and popular tradition is followed in <i>Hamlet</i>,
III, ii, 107-111:</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamlet.</span> What did you enact?</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Polonius.</span> I did enact Julius C&aelig;sar: I was kill'd i' the Capitol:
Brutus kill'd me.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Hamlet.</span> It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.</p>
</div>
<p>So also in <i>Antony and Cleopatra:</i></p>
</div>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p class="indent6">Since Julius C&aelig;sar,</p>
<p>Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,</p>

<p>Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,</p>
<p>With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,</p>
<p>To drench the Capitol; but that they would</p>
<p>Have one man but a man?</p>
</div>
<p class="right">[II, vi, 12-19.]</p>
</div>

<p>We have the same popular tradition in the first scene of
the last act of Fletcher's <i>The Noble Gentleman</i>. So, too,
in the Prologue to Beaumont and Fletcher's, or Fletcher
and Massinger's, <i>The False One</i>, a tragedy dealing with
C&aelig;sar and Cleopatra:</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p class="indent6">To tell</p>
<p>Of C&aelig;sar's amorous heats, and how he fell</p>
<p>I' the Capitol.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here the reference is to Shakespeare's play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Et_Tu_Brute" id="Et_Tu_Brute"><span class="smallcaps">"Et Tu, Brute"</span></a></h5>

<p>Dyce and other researchers have made clear that in
Shakespeare's day "<i>Et tu, Brute</i>" was a familiar phrase
which had special reference to a wound from a supposed
friend. It probably owed its popularity to having been
used in the earlier plays on the subject of Julius C&aelig;sar.
In <i>The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of York</i> (1595),
upon which Shakespeare's <i>3 Henry VI</i> is based, occurs the
line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Et tu, Brute?</i> wilt thou stab C&aelig;sar too?</p>
</div>

<p>This line is repeated in S. Nicholson's poem, <i>Acolastus, his
Afterwitte</i> (1600). In Ben Jonson's <i>Every Man out of His
Humour</i> (1599), Buffone uses "<i>Et tu, Brute</i>" in speaking
to Macilente (V, iv). In the <i>Myrroure for Magistrates</i>
(1587) we find,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>And Brutus thou, my sonne, quoth I, whom erst I loved best.</p>
</div>

<p>The Latin form of the phrase possibly originated, as
Malone suggested, in the Latin play referred to above
(Earlier Plays) which was acted at Oxford in 1582. It is
easy to see how the Elizabethan tendency to word-quibble
and equivoque would help to give currency to the Latin
form. Cf. Hamlet's joke on 'brute' quoted above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Brutus_Speech" id="Brutus_Speech"><span class="smallcaps">Brutus's Speech</span></a>, III, ii</h5>

<p>In view of the close connection between <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>
and <i>Hamlet</i> as regards date of composition and the
characterization of Brutus and Hamlet, interest attaches to Professor
Gollancz's theory (<i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, Temple Shakespeare)

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>

that the original of the famous speech of Brutus to the
assembled Romans (<a href="#sceneIII_2">III, ii</a>) may be found in Belleforest's
<i>History of Hamlet</i>, in the oration which Hamlet makes to
the Danes after he has slain his uncle. "The situation of
Hamlet is almost identical with that of Brutus after he has
dealt the blow, and the burden of Hamlet's too lengthy
speech finds an echo in Brutus's sententious utterance. The
verbose iteration of the Dane has been compressed to suit
'the brief compendious manner of speech of the Laced&aelig;monians.'"&mdash;Gollancz.
As the English translation from
which Professor Gollancz quotes in support of his theory is
dated 1608, and is the earliest known,<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_12" id="tagIntro_12"
href="#noteIntro_12">[12]</a> it cannot have
been from this that Shakespeare drew any suggestions or
material. The question arises, Did Shakespeare read the
speech in the original French? The volume of Belleforest's
<i>Histoires Tragiques</i>, which contained the story of
Hamlet, was first published in 1570, and there were many
reprintings of it before 1600.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Date_Of_Composition" id="Date_Of_Composition">II. DATE OF COMPOSITION</a></h5>

<p>Modern editors fix the date of composition of <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i> within 1601, the later time limit (<i>terminus ante
quem</i>), and 1598, the earlier time limit (<i>terminus post
quem</i>). The weight of evidence is in favor of 1600-1601.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="External_Evidence" id="External_Evidence"><span class="smallcaps">External Evidence</span></a></h5>

<p>1. <i>Negative.</i> <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is not mentioned by Meres in
the <i>Palladis Tamia</i>, published in 1598, which gives a list of
twelve noteworthy Shakespeare plays in existence at that time.
This establishes 1598 as a probable <i>terminus post quem</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Positive.</i> In John Weever's <i>Mirror of Martyrs or
the Life and Death of Sir John Oldcastle Knight, Lord
Cobham</i>, printed in 1601, are the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The many-headed multitude were drawne</p>
<p>By <i>Brutus</i> speech that <i>C&aelig;sar</i> was ambitious,</p>
<p>When eloquent <i>Mark Antonie</i> had showne</p>
<p>His vertues, who but <i>Brutus</i> then was vicious?</p>
<p class="inset">Man's memorie, with new, forgets the old,</p>
<p class="inset">One tale is good, until another's told.</p>
</div>

<p>Halliwell-Phillipps was the first to note that here is a
very pointed reference to the second scene of the third
act of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, as the antithesis brought out is not
indicated in any of Shakespeare's historical sources. The
fact that Weever states in his Dedication that the <i>Mirror</i>
"some two years agoe was made fit for the print" has been
held by Mr. Percy Simpson<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_13" id="tagIntro_13"
href="#noteIntro_13">[13]</a> to indicate that the play was
not brought out later than 1599, a conclusion supported, he
thinks, by a passage in Ben Jonson's <i>Every Man out of His
Humour</i>, produced in that year, where Clove (III, i) says,
"Then coming to the pretty animal, as <i>Reason long since is
fled to animals</i>, you know," which may be a sneering allusion
to Antony's "O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts"
(<a href="#tagIII_131">III, ii, 104</a>). The "<i>Et tu, Brute</i>" quotation in the same
play has been used to strengthen the argument. But the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>

lines from the <i>Mirror of Martyrs</i> quoted above may easily
have been inserted by Weever into his poem in consequence
of the popularity of Shakespeare's play. This contemporary
popularity is well attested. Leonard Digges,<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_14" id="tagIntro_14"
href="#noteIntro_14">[14]</a> in his verses
<i>Upon Master William Shakespeare</i> prefixed to the 1640
edition of Shakespeare's Poems, thus compares it with that
of Ben Jonson's Roman plays:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>So have I seene, when Cesar would appeare,</p>
<p>And on the Stage at halfe-sword parley were</p>
<p><i>Brutus</i> and <i>Cassius</i>: oh how the Audience</p>
<p>Were ravish'd, with what new wonder they went thence,</p>
<p>When some new day they would not brooke a line</p>
<p>Of tedious (though well laboured) <i>Catiline</i>;</p>
<p><i>Sejanus</i> too was irkesome, they priz'de more</p>
<p>Honest <i>Iago</i>, or the jealous <i>Moore</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>"Fustian" Clove's quotation may apply to references to
the Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of souls in
Shakespeare's earlier plays and other Elizabethan literature;
and little can be based upon the "<i>Et tu, Brute</i>" quotation,
as Ben Jonson may have drawn it from the same source as
Shakespeare did.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Henslowe in his <i>Diary</i> under May 22,
1602, notes that he advanced five pounds "in earneste of
a Boocke called <i>sesers Falle</i>," which the dramatists Munday,
Drayton, Webster, Middleton "and the Rest" were composing
for Lord Nottingham's Company. <i>C&aelig;sar's Fall</i> was
plainly intended to outshine Shakespeare's popular play,
but, as Professor Herford comments, "the lost play ...

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>

for the rival company would have been a somewhat tardy
counterblast to an old piece of 1599." He adds: "<i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i> was certainly not unconcerned in the revival of the
fashion for tragedies of revenge with a ghost in them, which
suddenly set in with Marston's <i>Antonio and Mellida</i> and
Chettle's <i>Hoffman</i> in 1601."</p>

<p>Dr. Furnivall, a strong advocate for 1601 as the date of
composition, has suggested<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_15" id="tagIntro_15"
href="#noteIntro_15">[15]</a> that Essex's ill-judged rebellion
against Queen Elizabeth, on Sunday, February 8, 1601, was
the reason of Shakespeare's producing his <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> in
that year. "Assuredly," he says, "the citizens of London
in that year who heard Shakespeare's play must have felt
the force of '<i>Et tu, Brute</i>,' and must have seen Brutus's
death, with keener and more home-felt influence than we
feel and hear the things with now."</p>

<p>Drayton's revised version of his <i>Mortimeriados</i> (1596-1597);
published in 1603 under the title of <i>The Barons'
Wars</i>, has a passage which strongly resembles some lines
in Antony's last speech (<a href="#tagV_137">V, v, 73-74</a>), but common property
in the idea that a well-balanced mixture of the four
elements (earth, air, fire, and water) produces a perfect
man invalidates any argument for the date of the play
based upon this evidence. See <a href="#noteV_138">note, p. 167, l. 73</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Internal_Evidence" id="Internal_Evidence"><span class="smallcaps">Internal Evidence</span></a></h5>

<p>Dr. W. A. Wright<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_16" id="tagIntro_16"
href="#noteIntro_16">[16]</a> has argued against an earlier date than
1600 for the composition of <i>Julius Caesar</i> from the use of
'eternal' for 'infernal' in <a href="#tagI_128">I, ii, 160</a>. See <a href="#noteI_128">note, p. 20, l. 160</a>.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>

Of course there is no certainty that Shakespeare wished
to use the word 'infernal,' and, besides, if any substitution
was made, it may have been at a later date. But adumbrations
of <i>Hamlet</i> everywhere in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, the frequent
references to C&aelig;sar in <i>Hamlet</i>, the kinship in character
of Brutus and Hamlet (see <a href="#noteII_36">note, p. 46, l. 65</a>), the treatment
of the supernatural, and the development of the revenge
motive give strong cumulative evidence that the
composition of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is in time very near to that
of <i>Hamlet</i>, the first Shakespearian draft of which is now
generally conceded to date from the first months of 1602.
The diction of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, the quality of the blank verse,
the style generally (see below, Versification and Diction),
all point to 1601 as the probable date of composition. It
has been said that a true taste for Shakespeare is like
the creation of a special sense; and this saying is nowhere
better approved than in reference to his subtile variations
of language and style. He began with what may be described
as a preponderance of the poetic element over
the dramatic. As we trace his course onward, we may discover
a gradual rising of the latter element into greater
strength and prominence, until at last it had the former
in complete subjection. Now, where positive external evidence
is wanting, it is mainly from the relative strength of
these elements that the probable date of the writing may
be argued. In <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> the diction is more gliding
and continuous, and the imagery more round and amplified,
than in the earlier dramas or in those known to belong
to Shakespeare's latest period.</p>

<p>These distinctive notes are of a nature more easily to be
felt than described, and to make them felt examples will best

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>

serve. Take then a passage from the soliloquy of Brutus just
after he has pledged himself to the conspiracy:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="indent3">'Tis a common proof,</p>
<p>That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</p>
<p>Whereto the climber upward turns his face;</p>
<p>But when he once attains the upmost round,</p>
<p>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</p>
<p>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</p>
<p>By which he did ascend. [<a href="#tagII_13">II, i, 21-27</a>.]</p>
</div>

<p>Here we have a full, rounded period in which all the elements
seem to have been adjusted, and the whole expression
set in order, before any part of it was written down.
The beginning foresees the end, the end remembers the
beginning, and the thought and image are evolved together
in an even, continuous flow. The thing is indeed perfect in
its way, still it is not in Shakespeare's latest and highest
style. Now take a passage from <i>The Winter's Tale</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="indent3">When you speak, sweet,</p>
<p>I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,</p>
<p>I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,</p>
<p>Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,</p>
<p>To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you</p>
<p>A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do</p>
<p>Nothing but that; move still, still so,</p>
<p>And own no other function. [IV, iv, 136-143.]</p>
</div>

<p>Here the workmanship seems to make and shape itself as it
goes along, thought kindling thought, and image prompting
image, and each part neither concerning itself with what has
gone before, nor with what is coming after. The very sweetness
has a certain piercing quality, and we taste it from clause
to clause, almost from word to word, as so many keen darts

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>

of poetic rapture shot forth in rapid succession. Yet the
passage, notwithstanding its swift changes of imagery and
motion, is perfect in unity and continuity.</p>

<h5><a name="Folios" id="Folios"><span class="smallcaps">Folios</span></a></h5>

<p>On November 8, 1623, Edward Blount and Isaac Jaggard
obtained formal license to print "Mr. William Shakespeere's
Comedyes, Histories, and Tragedyes, soe many of the said
copies as are not formerly entered to other men." This is
the description-entry in <i>The Stationers' Registers</i> of what
is now known as the First Folio (1623), designated in the
textual notes of this edition F<sub>1</sub>. <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is one of the
plays "not formerly entered,"<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_17" id="tagIntro_17"

far as is known, in this famous volume. It is more correctly
printed than perhaps any other play in the First Folio and,
as the editors of the Cambridge Shakespeare suggest, "may
perhaps have been (as the preface falsely implied that all
were<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_18" id="tagIntro_18"

<p>The Second Folio, F<sub>2</sub> (1632), the Third Folio, F<sub>3</sub> (1663,

Quarto contained one famous text variant, 'hath' for 'path'

<p>In the Folios and in the Quarto of 1691 the play is
divided into acts, but not into scenes, though the first act
is headed <i>Actus Primus, Sc&aelig;na Prima</i>. The first systematic
division into scenes was made by Nicholas Rowe,
poet laureate to George I, in the edition which he issued
in six octavo volumes in 1709. In this edition Rowe, an
experienced playwright, marked the entrances and exits
of the characters and introduced many stage directions and
the list of dramatis person&aelig; which has been the basis for
all later lists. A second edition in eight volumes was published
in 1714. Rowe followed very closely the text of the
Fourth Folio, but modernized spelling, punctuation, and
occasionally grammar. These are the first critical editions
of Shakespeare's plays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="The_Title" id="The_Title">IV. THE TITLE</a></h5>

<p>It has been justly observed that Shakespeare shows much
judgment in the naming of his plays. From this observation
several critics have excepted <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, pronouncing
the title a misnomer, on the ground that Brutus, and not
C&aelig;sar, is the hero of it. It is indeed true that Brutus is
the hero, but the play is rightly named, for C&aelig;sar is not
only the subject but also the governing power of it throughout.
He is the center and springhead of the entire action,
giving law and shape to everything that is said and done.
This is manifestly true in what occurs before his death;
and it is true in a still deeper sense afterwards, since his
genius then becomes the Nemesis or retributive Providence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Dramatic_Construction_And_Development" id="Dramatic_Construction_And_Development">V. DRAMATIC CONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT</a></h5>

<p><i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is a tragedy of a normal Shakespearian type,
in which is represented a conflict between an individual,
or group of individuals, and certain forces which environ,
antagonize, and overwhelm. The unity of action and of interest
is the personality of Julius C&aelig;sar. In dramatic technique
the play is simple and effective. Out of masses of
detail and historical incident the dramatist has shaped a
symmetrical and well-defined plot marked by (1) the exposition,
or introduction, (2) the complication, or rising action,
(3) the climax, or turning point, (4) the resolution, or falling
action, and (5) the catastrophe, or conclusion. It is
almost a commonplace of criticism that the opening scene
of a Shakespeare play strikes the keynote of the action.
It certainly does in a remarkable way in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>

introducing, on the one side, a group of excited citizens
friendly to C&aelig;sar, and, on the other, two tribunes hostile
to him. It foreshadows the character-contrasts in the play
and the conflict between the state and the individual.
The exposition continues through the second scene, in
which are introduced the leading characters in significant
action and interaction. At the close of this scene Cassius
lays his plans to win Brutus over to the conspiracy, and
the complication, or rising action, of the drama begins.
Through the last scene of the first act and the four scenes
of the second act the growth of the complication is continued,
with brief intervals of suspense, until, in the first
scene of the third act, the climax is reached in the assassination
of C&aelig;sar and the wild enthusiasm of the conspirators.
With the entry of Antony's servant begins the resolution,
or falling action (see <a href="#noteIII_55">note, p. 89, l. 123</a>), and from now,
through intervals of long suspense and many vicissitudes,<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_20" id="tagIntro_20"
href="#noteIntro_20">[20]</a>
the fortunes of the chief conspirators fall inevitably to the
catastrophe.</p>

<h5>I. <span class="smallcaps">The Exposition, or Introduction</span> (<span class="smallcaps">Tying of the Knot</span>)</h5>

<p><i><a href="#sceneI_1">Act I, Scene i</a></i>. The popularity of C&aelig;sar with the Roman mob and
the jealousy of the official classes&mdash;the two motive forces of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>

play&mdash;are revealed. The fickleness of the mob is shown in a spirit
of comedy; the antagonism of Marullus and Flavius strikes the note
of tragedy.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneI_2">Act I, Scene ii, 1-304</a></i>. The supreme characters are introduced,
and in their opening speeches each reveals his temperament and
foreshadows the part which he will play. The exposition of the
situation is now complete.</p>

<h5><span class="smallcaps">II. The Complication, Rising Action, or Growth (Tying Of
the Knot)</span></h5>

<p><i><a href="#tagI_2_305">Act I, Scene ii, 305-319</a></i>. In soliloquy Cassius unfolds his scheme
for entangling Brutus in the conspiracy, and the dramatic complication
begins.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneI_3">Act I, Scene iii</a></i>. Casca, excited by the fiery portents that bode
disaster to the state, is persuaded by Cassius to join "an enterprise
of honourable-dangerous consequence" (lines 123-124). The conspirators
are assigned to their various posts, and Cassius engages
to secure Brutus before morning.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneII_1">Act II, Scene i</a></i>. The humane character of Brutus, as master, husband,
and citizen, is elaborated, and his attitude to C&aelig;sar and the
conspiracy of assassination clearly shown. He joins the conspirators&mdash;apparently
their leader, in reality their tool. In lines 162-183 he
pleads that the life of Antony be spared, and thus unconsciously
prepares for his own ruin.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneII_2">Act II, Scene ii</a></i>. C&aelig;sar is uneasy at the omens and portents, and
gives heed to Calpurnia's entreaties to remain at home, but he yields
to the importunity of Decius and starts for the Capitol, thus advancing
the plans of the conspirators. The dramatic contrast between
C&aelig;sar and Brutus is strengthened by that between Calpurnia in this
scene and Portia in the preceding.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneII_3">Act II, Scene iii</a></i>. The dramatic interest is intensified by the warning
of Artemidorus and the suggestion of a way of escape for the
protagonist.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneII_4">Act II, Scene iv</a></i>. The interest is further intensified by the way
in which readers and spectators are made to share the anxiety of
Portia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smallcaps">III. The Climax, Crisis, or Turning Point (the Knot Tied)</span></h5>

<p><i><a href="#sceneIII_1">Act III, Scene i, 1-122</a></i>. The dramatic movement is now rapid, and
the tension, indicated by the short whispered sentences of all the
speakers except C&aelig;sar, is only increased by his imperial utterances,
which show utter unconsciousness of the impending doom. In the
assassination all the complicating forces&mdash;the self-confidence of
C&aelig;sar, the unworldly patriotism of Brutus, the political chicanery of
Cassius, the unscrupulousness of Casca, and the fickleness of the
mob&mdash;bring about an event which changes the lives of all the characters
concerned and threatens the stability of the Roman nation.
The death of C&aelig;sar is the climax of the physical action of the play;
it is at the same time the emotional crisis from which Brutus comes
with altered destiny.</p>

<h5><span class="smallcaps">IV. The Resolution, Falling Action, or Consequence (the
Untying of the Knot)</span></h5>

<p><i><a href="#tagIII_55">Act III, Scene i, 123-298</a></i>. With Brutus's "Soft! who comes here?
A friend of Antony's" begins the resolution, or falling action, of the
play. "The fortune of the conspirators, hitherto in the ascendant,
now declines, while 'C&aelig;sar's spirit' surely and steadily prevails
against them."&mdash;Verity. Against the advice of Cassius, Brutus gives
Antony permission to deliver a public funeral oration. Antony in a
soliloquy shows his determination to avenge C&aelig;sar, and the first
scene of the falling action closes with the announcement that Octavius
is within seven leagues of Rome.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneIII_2">Act III, Scene ii</a>&mdash;<a href="#sceneIII_3">Scene iii</a></i>. The orations of Antony, in vivid
contrast to the conciliatory but unimpassioned speeches of Brutus,
fire the people and liberate fresh forces in the falling action. Brutus
and Cassius have to fly the city, riding "like madmen through the
gates of Rome." In unreasoning fury the mob tears to pieces an
innocent poet who has the same name as a conspirator.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneIV_1">Act IV, Scene i</a></i>. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, having formed
a triumvirate of which Antony is the master spirit, agree on a proscription
list and join forces against Brutus and Cassius, who "are
levying powers."</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneIV_2">Act IV, Scene ii</a></i>. Brutus and Cassius, long parted by pride and
obstinacy, meet to discuss a plan of action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span></p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneIV_3">Act IV, Scene iii</a></i>. This is one of the most famous individual scenes
in Shakespeare (see note, page 123). Its intensely human interest
is always conceded, but its dramatic propriety, because of what seems
a 'dragging' tendency, has been often questioned. The scene opens
with Brutus and Cassius bandying recriminations, and the quarrel of
the two generals bodes disaster to their cause. As the discussion
proceeds, they yield points and become reconciled. Brutus then
quietly but with peculiar pathos tells of Portia's death by her own
hand. In all the great tragedies, with the notable exception of
<i>Othello</i>, when the forces of the resolution, or falling action, are
gathering towards the d&eacute;nouement, Shakespeare introduces a scene
which appeals to an emotion different from any of those excited
elsewhere in the play. "As a rule this new emotion is pathetic; and
the pathos is not terrible or lacerating, but, even if painful, is accompanied
by the sense of beauty and by an outflow of admiration or
affection, which come with an inexpressible sweetness after the
tension of the crisis and the first counter-stroke. So it is with the
reconciliation of Brutus and Cassius, and the arrival of the news of
Portia's death."&mdash;Bradley. While the shadow of her tragic passing
overhangs the spirits of both, Brutus overhears the shrewd, cautious
counsel of Cassius and persuades him to assent to the fatal policy of
offering battle at Philippi. That night the ghost of C&aelig;sar appears
to Brutus.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneV_1">Act V, Scene i</a></i>. The action now falls rapidly to the quick, decisive
movement of the d&eacute;nouement. The antagonists are now face to face.
Brutus and Cassius have done what Antony and Octavius hoped that
they would do. The opposing generals hold a brief parley in which
Brutus intimates that he is willing to effect a reconciliation, but
Antony rejects his proposals and bluntly charges him and Cassius
with the wilful murder of C&aelig;sar. Cassius reminds Brutus of his
warning that Antony should have fallen when C&aelig;sar did. Antony,
Octavius, and their army retire, and the scene closes with the noble
farewell without hope between Brutus and Cassius.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneV_2">Act V, Scene ii</a></i>. The opposing armies meet on the field, and a
final flare-up of hope in the breast of Brutus is indicated by his
spirited order to Messala to charge. The scene implies that Cassius
was defeated by being left without support by Brutus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span></p>

<h5>V. <span class="smallcaps">D&eacute;nouement, Catastrophe, or Conclusion (The Knot Untied)</span></h5>

<p><i><a href="#sceneV_3">Act V, Scene iii</a></i>. The charge ordered by Brutus has been successful,
and Octavius has been driven back, but Cassius is thus left unguarded,
and Antony's forces surround him. He takes refuge on a
hill and sends Titinius to see "whether yond troops are friend or
enemy." Believing Titinius to be slain, he begs Pindarus to stab
him, and Cassius dies "even with the sword that kill'd" C&aelig;sar.
With the same sword Titinius then slays himself, and Brutus, when
Messala bears the news to him, exclaims in words that strike the
keynote of the whole falling action and d&eacute;nouement:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>O Julius C&aelig;sar, thou art mighty yet!</p>
<p>Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords</p>
<p>In our own proper entrails.</p>
</div>

<p><i><a href="#sceneV_4">Act V, Scene iv</a></i>. Like Hamlet, Brutus at the last is a man of supreme
action. He rallies his forces for a last attack. With hopeless
failure before him, he is at once a heroic figure and one of infinite
pathos. Young Cato falls. Lucilius is attacked; assuming the name
of Brutus, he is not killed but taken prisoner. Antony recognizes
him and gives orders that he be treated kindly.</p>

<p><i><a href="#sceneV_5">Act V, Scene v</a></i>. Brutus dies by his own sword, and his last words
tell the story of failure and defeat. Like a true Roman, he meets
his doom without a murmur of complaint. He had been true to his
ideals. The tragic d&eacute;nouement comes as the inevitable consequence,
not of wilful sin, but of a noble mistake. In death he commands the
veneration of both Antony and Octavius, who pronounce over his
body the great interpretation of his character, and in their speeches
the tragedy closes as with a chant of victory for the hero of defeat.</p>

this coincident with "the feast of Lupercal" on February 15,

of days. Octavius did not reach Rome until upwards

is told by his servant immediately after the funeral oration
that "Octavius is already come to Rome." In November,
<span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> 43, the triumvirs met to make up their bloody proscription,

deviation from historical accuracy is in making the conference
of the triumvirs take place at Rome and not at Bononia.

in placing this fateful colloquy in the city that was the center

<h5><a name="Versification_And_Diction" id="Versification_And_Diction">VII. VERSIFICATION AND DICTION</a></h5>

<h5><a name="Blank_Verse" id="Blank_Verse"><span class="smallcaps">Blank Verse</span></a></h5>

<p>The characteristics of Shakespeare's blank verse&mdash;the
rhymeless, iambic five-stress (decasyllabic) verse, or iambic
pentameter, introduced into England by Henry Howard,
Earl of Surrey, about 1540&mdash;and its proportion to rhyme
and to prose have been much used in recent years to
determine the chronological order of the plays and the development
of the poet's art. In blank verse as used by
Shakespeare we have really an epitome of the development
of the measure in connection with the English drama. In
his earlier plays the blank verse is often similar to that of
<i>Gorboduc</i>, the first English tragedy. The tendency is to
adhere to the syllable-counting principle, to make the line
the unit, the sentence and phrase coinciding with the line
(end-stopped verse), and to use five perfect iambic feet to
the line. In plays of the middle period, such as <i>The Merchant
of Venice</i> and <i>As You Like It</i>, written between 1596
and 1600, the blank verse is more like that of Kyd and
Marlowe, with less monotonous regularity in the structure
and an increasing tendency to carry on the sense from one
line to another without a syntactical or rhetorical pause at
the end of the line (run-on verse, <i>enjambement</i>). Redundant
syllables now abound and the melody is richer and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span>

fuller. In Shakespeare's later plays the blank verse breaks
away from all bondage to formal line limits, and the organic
continuity is found in a succession of great metrical periods.</p>

<p>The verse of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is less monotonously regular
than that of the earlier plays; it is more flexible and varied,
more musical and sonorous, but it lacks the superb movement
of the verse in <i>Othello</i>, <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, and <i>The
Tempest</i>. End-stopped, normally regular iambic pentameter
lines often occur (as, for instance, <a href="#tagI_1_37">I, i, 37</a>, 41, 44, 62,
76), but everywhere are variations and deviations from the
norm, and there is an unusual number of short lines and
interjectional lines of two or three stresses. See Abbott's <i>A
Shakespearian Grammar</i>, &sect;&sect; 511, 512.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Rhyme" id="Rhyme"><span class="smallcaps">Rhyme</span></a></h5>

<p>Apart from the use of rhyme in songs, lyrics, and portions
of masques (as in <i>The Tempest</i>, IV, i, 60-138), a progress
from more to less rhyme is a sure index to Shakespeare's
development as a dramatist and a master of expression. In
the early <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> are more than one thousand
rhyming five-stress iambic lines; in <i>The Tempest</i> are only
two; in <i>The Winter's Tale</i> not one. <i>In Julius C&aelig;sar</i> are
found only thirty-four rhyming lines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Prose" id="Prose"><span class="smallcaps">Prose</span></a></h5>

<p>If "of the soule the bodie forme doth take," it is small
wonder that attempts have been made to explain Shakespeare's
distinctive use of verse and prose. Of recent years
there have been interesting discussions of the question
"whether we are justified in supposing that Shakespeare

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</a></span>

was guided by any fixed principle in his employment of
verse and prose, or whether he merely employed them, as
fancy suggested, for the sake of variety and relief."<a class="tag" name="tagIntro_22" id="tagIntro_22" href="#noteIntro_22">[22]</a> It is a
significant fact that in many of Shakespeare's earlier plays
there is little or no prose, and that the proportion of prose
to blank verse increases with the decrease of rhyme. In
<i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> three kinds of prose may be distinguished:
(1) The prose of homely dialogue, as in the talk of the common
people in <a href="#sceneI_1">I, i</a>, and <a href="#sceneIII_3">III, iii</a>. (2) The prose of serious
information as to the nature of a situation, as in Casca's
description of the offer of the crown to C&aelig;sar. This kind
of prose reaches its highest development in Brutus's famous
speech, <a href="#sceneIII_2">III, ii</a>, with its dignified defense and laconic exposition
of his honesty of purpose. (3) The prose of formal
documents, as in the letter of Artemidorus, <a href="#sceneII_3">II, iii, 1-8</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="The_Characters" id="The_Characters">VIII. THE CHARACTERS</a></h5>

<h5><a name="Julius_Caesar" id="Julius_Caesar"><span class="smallcaps">Julius C&aelig;sar</span></a></h5>

<p>The characterization of this drama in some of the parts is
not a little perplexing. Hardly one of the speeches put into
C&aelig;sar's mouth can be regarded as historically characteristic;
taken all together, they seem little short of a caricature.
As here represented, C&aelig;sar appears little better than a braggart;
and when he speaks, it is in the style of a glorious
vapourer, full of lofty airs and mock thunder. Nothing could

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</a></span>

be further from the truth of the man, whose character, even
in his faults, was as compact and solid as adamant, and at the
same time as limber and ductile as the finest gold. Certain
critics have seized and worked upon this, as proving Shakespeare's
lack of classical knowledge, or carelessness in the use
of his authorities. It proves neither the one nor the other.</p>

<p>It is true, C&aelig;sar's ambition was gigantic, but none too
much so for the mind it dwelt in; for his character in all its
features was gigantic. And no man ever framed his ambition
more in sympathy with the great forces of nature,
or built it upon a deeper foundation of political wisdom
and insight. Now this "last infirmity of noble minds" is
the only part of him that the play really sets before us; and
even this we do not see as it was, because it is here severed
from the constitutional peerage of his gifts and virtues; all
those transcendent qualities which placed him at the summit
of Roman intellect and manhood being either withheld
from the scene or thrown so far into the background that
the proper effect of them is lost.</p>

<p>Yet we have ample proof that Shakespeare understood
C&aelig;sar thoroughly, and that he regarded him as "the noblest
man that ever lived in the tide of times." For example, in
<i>Hamlet</i>, he makes Horatio, who is one of his calmest and
most right-thinking characters, speak of him as "the mightiest
Julius." In <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, again, the heroine
is made to describe him as "broad-fronted C&aelig;sar"; and in
<i>King Richard the Third</i> the young Prince utters these lines:</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p>That Julius C&aelig;sar was a famous man:</p>
<p>With what his valour did enrich his wit,</p>
<p>His wit set down to make his valour live:</p>
<p>Death makes no conquest of this conqueror.</p>
</div>
<p class="right">[III, i, 84-87.]</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, we need not go beyond Shakespeare to gather that
Julius C&aelig;sar's was the deepest, the most versatile, and the
most multitudinous head that ever figured in the political
affairs of mankind.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is clear from this play itself that Shakespeare
did not proceed at all from ignorance or misconception of
the man. For it is remarkable that, though C&aelig;sar delivers
himself so out of character, yet others, both foes and
friends, deliver him much nearer the truth; so that, while
we see almost nothing of him directly, we nevertheless
get, upon the whole, a just reflection of him. Especially in
the marvelous speeches of Antony and in the later events
of the drama, both his inward greatness and his right of
mastership over the Roman world are fully vindicated.
For in the play as in the history, C&aelig;sar's blood hastens
and cements the empire which the conspirators thought to
prevent. They soon find that in the popular sympathies,
and even in their own dumb remorses, he has "left behind
powers that will work for him." He proves, indeed, far
mightier in death than in life; as if his spirit were become
at once the guardian angel of his cause and an avenging
angel to his foes.</p>

<p>And so it was in fact. Nothing did so much to set the
people in love with royalty, both name and thing, as the
reflection that their beloved C&aelig;sar, the greatest of their
national heroes, the crown and consummation of Roman
genius and character, had been murdered for aspiring to it.
Thus their hereditary aversion to kingship was all subdued
by the remembrance of how and why their C&aelig;sar fell; and
they who, before, would have plucked out his heart rather
than he should wear a crown, would now have plucked out

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</a></span>

their own, to set a crown upon his head. Such is the natural
result, when the intensities of admiration and compassion
meet together in the human breast.</p>

<p>From all which it may well be thought that C&aelig;sar was too
great for the hero of a drama, since his greatness, if brought
forward in full measure, would leave no room for anything
else, at least would preclude any proper dramatic balance
and equipoise. It was only as a sort of underlying potency,
or a force withdrawn into the background, that his presence
was compatible with that harmony and reciprocity of several
characters which a well-ordered drama requires. At all
events, it is pretty clear that, where he was, such figures as
Brutus and Cassius could never be very considerable, save
as his assassins. They would not have been heard of in
after times, if they had not "struck the foremost man of all
this world"; in other words, the great sun of Rome had to be
shorn of his beams, else so ineffectual a fire as Brutus could
nowise catch the eye.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, there is no doubt that Shakespeare knew
the whole height and compass of C&aelig;sar's vast and varied
capacity. It may be regretted that he did not render him
as he evidently saw him, inasmuch as he alone, perhaps, of
all the men who ever wrote could have given an adequate
expression of that colossal man.</p>

<p>It is possible that the policy of the drama may have been
to represent C&aelig;sar not as he was indeed, but as he must
have appeared to the conspirators; to make us see him as
they saw him, in order that they too might have fair and
equal judgment at our hands. For C&aelig;sar was literally too
great to be seen by them, save as children often see bugbears
by moonlight, when their inexperienced eyes are

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</a></span>

mocked with air. And Shakespeare may well have judged
that the best way to set us right towards them was by identifying
us more or less with them in mental position, and
making us share somewhat in their delusion. For there is
scarce anything wherein we are so apt to err as in reference
to the characters of men, when time has settled and cleared
up the questions in which they lost their way: we blame
them for not having seen as we see; while in truth the
things that are so bathed in light to us were full of darkness
to them, and we should have understood them better,
had we been in the dark along with them.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar, indeed, was not bewildered by the political questions
of his time; but all the rest were, and therefore he
seemed so to them; and while their own heads were swimming
they naturally ascribed his seeming bewilderment to a
dangerous intoxication. As for his marvelous career of success,
they attributed this mainly to his good luck, such being
the common refuge of inferior minds when they would escape
the sense of their inferiority. Hence, as generally happens
with the highest order of men, his greatness had to wait the
approval of later events. He indeed, far beyond any other
man of his age, "looked into the seeds of time"; but this
was not, and could not be known, till time had developed
those seeds into their fruits. Why then may not Shakespeare's
idea have been so to order things that the full
strength of the man should not appear in the play, as it
did not in fact, till after his fall? This view will both explain
and justify the strange disguise&mdash;a sort of falsetto
greatness&mdash;under which C&aelig;sar exhibits himself.</p>

<p>Now the seeming contradiction between C&aelig;sar as known
and C&aelig;sar as rendered by Shakespeare is what, more than

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</a></span>

anything else, perplexes. But a very refined, subtile, and
peculiar irony pervades this, more than any other of Shakespeare's
plays; not intended as such, indeed, by the speakers,
but a sort of historic irony,&mdash;the irony of Providence,
so to speak, or, if you please, of Fate; much the same as
is implied in the proverb, "A haughty spirit goeth before a
fall." This irony crops out in many places. Thus we have
C&aelig;sar most blown with arrogance and godding it in the
loftiest style when the daggers of the assassins are on the
very point of leaping at him. So too, all along, we find
Brutus most confident in those very things where he is most
at fault, or acting like a man "most ignorant of what he's
most assured"; as when he says that "Antony can do no
more than C&aelig;sar's arm when C&aelig;sar's head is off." This,
to be sure, is not meant ironically by him, but it is turned
into irony by the fact that Antony soon tears the cause of
the conspirators all to pieces with his tongue. But, indeed,
this sort of honest guile runs all through the piece as a perfusive
and permeating efficacy. A still better instance of it
occurs just after the murder, when the chiefs of the conspiracy
are exulting in the transcendent virtue and beneficence
of their deed, and in its future stage celebrity; and
Cassius says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p>So often shall the knot of us be call'd</p>
<p>The men that gave their country liberty.</p>
<p class="right">[<a href="#tagIII_1_118">III, i, 118-119</a>.]</p>
</div></div>

<p>and again, a little later, when Brutus says of Antony, "I know
that we shall have him well to friend." Not indeed that the
men themselves thought any irony in those speeches: it was
natural, no doubt, that they should utter such things in all
seriousness; but what they say is interpreted into irony by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">xl</a></span>

the subsequent events. And when such a shallow idealist as
Brutus is made to overtop and outshine the greatest practical
genius the world ever saw, what is it but a refined and
subtile irony at work on a much larger scale, and diffusing
itself, secretly, it may be, but not the less vitally, into the
texture? It was not the frog that thought irony, when he
tried to make himself as big as the ox; but there was a
pretty decided spice of irony in the mind that conceived
the fable.</p>

<p>It is to be noted further that Brutus uniformly speaks of
C&aelig;sar with respect, almost indeed with admiration. It is his
ambition, not his greatness, that Brutus resents; the thought
that his own consequence is impaired by C&aelig;sar's elevation
having no influence with him. With Cassius, on the contrary,
impatience of his superiority is the ruling motive: he
is all the while thinking of the disparagement he suffers by
C&aelig;sar's exaltation.</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p class="indent6">This man</p>
<p>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</p>
<p>A wretched creature, and must bend his body</p>
<p>If C&aelig;sar carelessly but nod on him.</p>
<p class="right">[<a href="#tagI_2_115">I, ii, 115-118</a>.]</p>
<p>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</p>
<p>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</p>
<p>Walk under his huge legs.</p>
<p class="right">[<a href="#tagI_117">I, ii, 135-137</a>.]</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus he overflows with mocking comparisons, and finds his
pastime in flouting at C&aelig;sar as having managed by a sham
heroism to hoodwink the world.</p>

<p>And yet Shakespeare makes C&aelig;sar characterize himself
very much as Cassius, in his splenetic temper, describes
him. C&aelig;sar gods it in his talk, as if on purpose to approve
the style in which Cassius mockingly gods him. This, taken

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">xli</a></span>

by itself, would look as if the dramatist sided with Cassius;
yet one can hardly help feeling that he sympathized rather
in Antony's great oration. And the sequel, as we have seen,
justifies Antony's opinion of C&aelig;sar. The subsequent course
of things has the effect of inverting the mockery of Cassius
against himself.</p>

<p>The final issue of the conspiracy, as represented by Shakespeare,
is a pretty conclusive argument of the blunder, not
to say the crime, of its authors. C&aelig;sar, dead, tears them
and their cause all to pieces. In effect, they did but stab
him into a mightier life; so that Brutus might well say, as
indeed he does at last,&mdash;</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p>O Julius C&aelig;sar, thou art mighty yet!</p>
<p>Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords</p>
<p>In our own proper entrails.</p>
<p class="right">[<a href="#tagV_3_94">V, iii, 94-96</a>.]</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Nemesis which asserts itself so sternly in the latter part
of the play may be regarded as a reflex of irony on some of
the earlier scenes. This view infers the disguise of C&aelig;sar to
be an instance of the profound guile with which Shakespeare
sometimes plays upon his characters, humoring their bent,
and then leaving them to the discipline of events.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Brutus" id="Brutus"><span class="smallcaps">Brutus</span></a></h5>

<p>Coleridge has a shrewd doubt as to what sort of a character
Shakespeare meant his Brutus to be. For, in his thinking
aloud just after the breaking of the conspiracy to him,
Brutus avowedly grounds his purpose, not on anything C&aelig;sar
has done, nor on what he is, but simply on what he <i>may become</i>
when crowned. He "knows no personal cause to spurn
at him"; nor has he "known when his affections sway'd

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">xlii</a></span>

more than his reason"; but "he would be crown'd: how
that might change his nature, there's the question"; and,</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p class="indent6">Since the quarrel</p>
<p>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</p>
<p>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</p>
<p>Would run to these and these extremities;</p>
<p>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</p>
<p>Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,</p>
<p>And kill him in the shell.</p>
<p class="right">[<a href="#tagII_17">II, i, 28-34</a>.]</p>
</div></div>

<p>So then Brutus heads a plot to assassinate the man who, besides
being clothed with the sanctions of law as the highest
representative of the state, has been his personal friend and
benefactor; all this, too, not on any ground of fact, but on
an assumed probability that the crown will prove a sacrament
of evil, and transform him into quite another man. A
strange piece of casuistry indeed! but nowise unsuited to
the spirit of a man who was to commit the gravest of crimes,
purely from a misplaced virtue.</p>

<p>And yet the character of Brutus is full of beauty and
sweetness. In all the relations of life he is upright, gentle,
and pure; of a sensitiveness and delicacy of principle that
cannot bosom the slightest stain; his mind enriched and
fortified with the best extractions of philosophy; a man
adorned with all the virtues which, in public and private,
at home and in the circle of friends, win respect and charm
the heart.</p>

<p>Being such a man, of course he could only do what he did
under some sort of delusion. And so indeed it is. Yet this
very delusion serves, apparently, to ennoble and beautify
him, as it takes him and works upon him through his virtues.
At heart he is a real patriot, every inch of him. But his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">xliii</a></span>

patriotism, besides being somewhat hidebound with patrician
pride, is of the speculative kind, and dwells, where his whole
character has been chiefly formed, in a world of poetical and
philosophic ideals. He is an enthusiastic student of books.
Plato is his favorite teacher; and he has studiously framed
his life and tuned his thoughts to the grand and pure conceptions
won from that all but divine source: Plato's genius
walks with him in the Senate, sits with him at the fireside,
goes with him to the wars, and still hovers about his tent.</p>

<p>His great fault, then, lies in supposing it his duty to be
meddling with things that he does not understand. Conscious
of high thoughts and just desires, but with no gift of
practical insight, he is ill fitted to "grind among the iron
facts of life." In truth, he does not really see where he is;
the actual circumstances and tendencies amidst which he
lives are as a book written in a language he cannot read.
The characters of those who act with him are too far below
the region of his principles and habitual thinkings for him to
take the true cast of them. Himself incapable of such motives
as govern them, he just projects and suspends his ideals
in them, and then misreckons upon them as realizing the
men of his own brain. So also he clings to the idea of the
great and free republic of his fathers, the old Rome that has
ever stood to his feelings touched with the consecrations of
time and glorified with the high virtues that have grown up
under her cherishing. But, in the long reign of tearing faction
and civil butchery, that which he worships has been substantially
changed, the reality lost. C&aelig;sar, already clothed
with the title and the power of Imperator for life, would
change the form so as to agree with the substance, the name
so as to fit the thing. But Brutus is so filled with the idea

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">xliv</a></span>

of that which has thus passed away never to return that
he thinks to save or recover the whole by preventing such
formal and nominal change.</p>

<p>And so his whole course is that of one acting on his
own ideas, not on the facts that are before and around him.
Indeed, he does not <i>see</i> them; he merely dreams his own
meaning into them. He is swift to do that by which he
thinks his country <i>ought to be benefited</i>. As the killing of
C&aelig;sar stands in his purpose, he and his associates are to be
"sacrificers, not butchers." But that the deed may have the
effect he hopes for, his countrymen generally must regard
it in the same light as he does. That they will do this is
the very thing which he has <i>in fact</i> no reason to conclude;
notwithstanding, because it is so <i>in his idea</i>, therefore he
trusts that the conspirators will "be called purgers, not murderers."
Meanwhile, the plain truth is, that if his countrymen
had been capable of regarding the deed as a sacrifice,
they would not have made nor permitted any occasion for
it. It is certain that, unless so construed, the act must
prove fruitful of evil; all Rome is full of things proving that
it cannot be so construed; but this is what Brutus has no
eye to see.</p>

<p>So too, in his oration "to show the <i>reason</i> of our C&aelig;sar's
death," he speaks, in calm and dispassionate manner, just
those things which he thinks ought to set the people right
and himself right in their eyes, forgetting all the while that
the deed cannot fail to make the people mad, and that popular
madness is not a thing to be reasoned with. And for
the same cause he insists on sparing Antony, and on permitting
him to speak in C&aelig;sar's funeral. To do otherwise
would be unjust, and so would overthrow the whole nature

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">xlv</a></span>

of the enterprise as it lives in his mind. And because in
his idea it ought so to be, he trusts that Antony will make
C&aelig;sar's death the occasion of strengthening those who killed
him, not perceiving the strong likelihood, which soon passes
into a fact, that in cutting off C&aelig;sar they have taken away
the only check on Antony's ambition. He ought to have
foreseen that Antony, instead of being drawn to their side,
would rather make love to C&aelig;sar's place at their expense.</p>

<p>Thus the course of Brutus serves no end but to set on
foot another civil war, which naturally hastens and assures
the very thing he sought to prevent. He confides in the
goodness of his cause, not considering that the better the
cause, the worse its chance with bad men. He thinks it safe
to trust others because he knows they can safely trust him;
the singleness of his own eye causing him to believe that
others will see as he sees, the purity of his own heart, that
others will feel as he feels.</p>

<p>Here then we have a strong instance of a very good man
doing a very bad thing; and, withal, of a wise man acting
most unwisely because his wisdom knew not its place; a
right noble, just, heroic spirit bearing directly athwart the
virtues he worships. On the whole, it is not wonderful that
Brutus should have exclaimed, as he is said to have done,
that he had worshiped virtue and found her at last but a
shade. So worshiped, she may well prove a shade indeed!
Admiration of the man's character, reprobation of his proceedings,&mdash;which
of these is the stronger with us? And
there is much the same irony in the representation of
Brutus as in that of C&aelig;sar; only the order of it is here
reversed. As if one should say, "O yes, yes! in the practical
affairs of mankind your charming wisdom of the closet

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</a></span>

will doubtless put to shame the workings of mere practical
insight and sagacity."</p>

<p>Shakespeare's exactness in the minutest details of character
is well shown in the speech already referred to; which
is the utterance of a man philosophizing most unphilosophically;
as if the Academy should betake itself to the stump,
and this too without any sense of the incongruity. Plutarch
has a short passage which served as a hint, not indeed for
the matter, but for the style of that speech. "They do note,"
says he, "in some of his epistles that he counterfeited that
brief compendious manner of speech of the Laced&aelig;monians.
As, when the war was begun, he wrote unto the Pergamenians
in this sort: 'I understand you have given Dolabella money:
if you have done it willingly, you confess you have offended
me; if against your wills, show it then by giving me willingly.'...
These were Brutus' manner of letters, which
were honoured for their briefness." The speech in question
is far enough indeed from being a model of style either for
oratory or anything else, but it is finely characteristic; while
its studied primness and epigrammatic finish contrast most
unfavorably with the frank-hearted yet artful eloquence of
Antony.</p>

<p>And what a rare significance attaches to the brief scene
of Brutus and his drowsy boy Lucius in camp a little before
the catastrophe! There, in the deep of the night, long after
all the rest have lost themselves in sleep, and when the
anxieties of the issue are crowding upon him,&mdash;there we
have the earnest, thoughtful Brutus hungering intensely for
the repasts of treasured thought.</p>

<div class="text">
<div class="poem">
<p>Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;</p>
<p>I put it in the pocket of my gown.</p>
<p class="right">[<a href="#tagIV_3_252">IV, iii, 252, 253</a>.]</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">xlvii</a></span></p>

<p>What the man is, and where he ought to be, is all signified
in these two lines. And do we not taste a dash of benignant
irony in the implied repugnance between the spirit
of the man and the stuff of his present undertaking? The
idea of a bookworm riding the whirlwind of war! The thing
is most like Brutus; but how out of his element, how unsphered
from his right place, it shows him! There is a
touch of drollery in the contrast, which the richest steeping
of poetry does not disguise. And the irony is all the more
delectable for being so remote and unpronounced; like
one of those choice arrangements in the background of a
painting, which, without attracting conscious notice, give a
zest and relish to what stands in front. The scene, whether
for charm of sentiment or felicity of conception, is one of the
finest in Shakespeare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Brutus_And_Cassius" id="Brutus_And_Cassius"><span class="smallcaps">Brutus and Cassius</span></a></h5>

<p>The characters of Brutus and Cassius are nicely discriminated,
scarce a word falling from either but what smacks of
the man. Cassius is much the better conspirator, but much
the worse man; and the better in that because the worse
in this. For Brutus engages in the conspiracy on grounds
of abstract and ideal justice; while Cassius holds it both a
wrong and a blunder to go about such a thing without making
success his first care. This, accordingly, is what he
works for, being reckless of all other considerations in his
choice and use of means. Withal he is more impulsive and
quick than Brutus, because less under the self-discipline of
moral principle. His motives, too, are of a much more
mixed and various quality, because his habits of thinking
and acting have grown by the measures of experience; he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">xlviii</a></span>

studies to understand men as they are; Brutus, as he thinks
they ought to be. Hence, in every case where Brutus crosses
him, Brutus is wrong, and he is right,&mdash;right, that is, if
success be their aim. Cassius judges, and surely rightly,
that the end should give law to the means; and that "the
honorable men whose daggers have stabb'd C&aelig;sar" should
not be hampered much with conscientious scruples.</p>

<p>Still Brutus overawes him by his moral energy and elevation
of character, and by the open-faced rectitude and purity
of his principles. Brutus has no thoughts or aims that he is
afraid or ashamed to avow; Cassius has many which he
would fain hide even from himself. And he catches a sort
of inspiration and is raised above himself by contact with
Brutus. And Cassius, moreover, acts very much from personal
hatred of C&aelig;sar, as remembering how, not long before,
he and Brutus had stood for the chief pr&aelig;torship of the
city, and Brutus through C&aelig;sar's favor had got the election.
And so Shakespeare read in Plutarch that "Cassius, being
a choleric man, and hating C&aelig;sar privately more than he
did the tyranny openly, incensed Brutus against him." The
effect of this is finely worked out by the dramatist in the
man's affected scorn of C&aelig;sar, and in the scoffing humor
in which he loves to speak of him. For such is the natural
language of a masked revenge.</p>

<p>The tone of Cassius is further indicated, and with exquisite
art, in his soliloquy where, after tempering Brutus to
his purpose, and finding how his "honorable metal may
be wrought," he gently slurs him for being practicable to
flatteries, and then proceeds to ruminate the scheme for
working upon his vanity, and thereby drawing him into the
conspiracy; thus spilling the significant fact, that his own

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">xlix</a></span>

honor does not stick to practice the arts by which he thinks
it is a shame to be seduced.</p>

<p>It is a noteworthy point also that Cassius is too practical
and too much of a politician to see any ghosts. Acting on
far lower principles than his leader, and such as that leader
would spurn as both wicked and base, he therefore does no
violence to his heart in screwing it to the work he takes in
hand; his heart is even more at home in the work than his
head; whereas Brutus, from the wrenching his heart has
suffered, keeps reverting to the moral complexion of his
first step. The remembrance of this is a thorn in his side;
while Cassius has no sensibilities of nature for such compunctions
to stick upon. Brutus is never thoroughly himself
after the assassination; that his heart is ill at ease is shown
in a certain dogged tenacity of honor and overstraining of
rectitude, as if he were struggling to make atonement with
his conscience. The stab he gave C&aelig;sar planted in his own
upright and gentle nature a germ of remorse, which, gathering
strength from every subsequent adversity, came to embody
itself in imaginary sights and sounds; the spirit of
justice, made an ill angel to him by his own sense of wrong,
hovering in the background of his after life, and haunting
his solitary moments in the shape of C&aelig;sar's ghost. And
so it is well done, that he is made to see the "monstrous
apparition" just after his heart has been pierced through
with many sorrows at hearing of Portia's shocking death.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="Portia" id="Portia"><span class="smallcaps">Portia</span></a></h5>

<p>The delineation of Portia is completed in a few brief
masterly strokes. Once seen, the portrait ever after lives
an old and dear acquaintance of the reader's inner man.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">l</a></span>

Portia has strength enough to do and suffer for others, but
very little for herself. As the daughter of Cato and the wife
of Brutus, she has set in her eye a pattern of how she ought
to think and act, being "so father'd and so husbanded"; but
still her head floats merged over the ears in her heart;
and it is only when affection speaks that her spirit is hushed
into the listening which she would fain yield only to the
speech of reason. She has a clear idea of the stoical calmness
and fortitude which appears so noble and so graceful
in her Brutus; it all lies faithfully reproduced in her mind;
she knows well how to honor and admire it; yet she cannot
work it into the texture of her character; she can talk
it like a book, but she tries in vain to live it.</p>

<p>Plutarch gives one most touching incident respecting
her which Shakespeare did not use, though he transfused
the sense of it into his work. It occurred some time after
C&aelig;sar's death, and when the civil war was growing to a
head: "Brutus, seeing the state of Rome would be utterly
overthrown, went ... unto the city of Elea standing by the
sea. There Portia, being ready to depart from her husband
Brutus and to return to Rome, did what she could to dissemble
the grief and sorrow she felt at her heart. But a
certain painted table (picture) bewrayed her in the end....
The device was taken out of the Greek stories, how Andromache
accompanied her husband Hector when he went out
of the city of Troy to go to the wars, and how Hector delivered
her his little son, and how her eyes were never off
him. Portia, seeing this picture, and likening herself to be
in the same case, she fell a-weeping; and coming thither
oftentimes in a day to see it, she wept still." The force of
this incident is reproduced in the Portia of the play; we

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">li</a></span>

have its full effect in the matter about her self-inflicted
wound as compared with her subsequent demeanor.</p>

<p>Portia gives herself that gash without flinching, and bears
it without a murmur, as an exercise and proof of fortitude;
and she translates her pains into smiles, all to comfort and
support her husband. So long as this purpose lends her
strength, she is fully equal to her thought, because here her
heart keeps touch perfectly with her head. But, this motive
gone, the weakness, if it be not rather the strength, of her
woman's nature rushes full upon her; her feelings rise into
an uncontrollable flutter, and run out at every joint and
motion of her body; and nothing can arrest the inward
mutiny till affection again whispers her into composure, lest
she say something that may hurt or endanger her Brutus.</p>

<h5><a name="Antony" id="Antony"><span class="smallcaps">Antony</span></a></h5>

<p>Shakespeare's completed characterization of Antony is in
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>. In the later play Antony is delineated
with his native aptitudes for vice warmed into full development
by the great Egyptian sorceress. In <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>
Shakespeare emphasizes as one of Antony's characteristic
traits his unreserved adulation of C&aelig;sar, shown in reckless
purveying to his dangerous weakness,&mdash;the desire to be
called a king. Already C&aelig;sar had more than kingly power,
and it was the obvious part of a friend to warn him against
this ambition. Here and there are apt indications of his
proneness to those vicious levities and debasing luxuries
which afterwards ripened into such a gigantic profligacy.
He has not yet attained to that rank and full-blown combination
of cruelty, perfidy, and voluptuousness, which the
world associates with his name, but he is plainly on the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">lii</a></span>

way to it. His profound and wily dissimulation, while knitting
up the hollow truce with the assassins on the very
spot where "great C&aelig;sar fell," is managed with admirable
skill; his deep spasms of grief being worked out in just the
right way to quench their suspicions, and make them run
into the toils, when he calls on them to render him their
bloody hands. Nor have they any right to complain, for he
is but paying them in their own coin; and we think none
the worse of him that he fairly outdoes them at their own
practice.</p>

<p>But Antony's worst parts as here delivered are his exultant
treachery in proposing to use his colleague Lepidus as at
once the pack-horse and the scape-goat of the Triumvirate,
and his remorseless savagery in arranging for the slaughter
of all that was most illustrious in Rome, bartering away his
own uncle, to glut his revenge with the blood of Cicero;
though even here his revenge was less hideous than the
cold-blooded policy of young Octavius. Yet Antony has in
the play, as he had in fact, some right noble streaks in him;
for his character was a very mixed one; and there was to the
last a fierce war of good and evil within him. Especially he
had an eye to see, a heart to feel, and a soul to honor the
superb structure of manhood which Rome possessed in
Julius C&aelig;sar, who stood to him, indeed, as a kind of superior
nature, to raise him above himself. He "fear'd C&aelig;sar,
honour'd him, and lov'd him"; and with the murdered
C&aelig;sar for his theme, he was for once inspired and kindled
to a rapture of the truest, noblest, most overwhelming eloquence.
Noteworthy also is the grateful remembrance at
last of his obligations to Brutus for having saved him from
the daggers of the conspirators.</p>

<h5><a name="The_People" id="The_People"><span class="smallcaps">The People</span></a></h5>

<p>That many-headed, but withal big-souled creature, the
multitude, is charmingly characterized in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.
The common people, it is true, are rather easily swayed
hither and thither by the contagion of sympathy and of
persuasive speech; yet their feelings are in the main right,
and even their judgment in the long run is better than that
of the pampered Roman aristocracy, inasmuch as it proceeds
more from the instincts of manhood. Shakespeare
evidently loved to play with the natural, unsophisticated,
though somewhat childish heart of the people; but his playing
is always genial and human-hearted, with a certain angelic
humor in it that seldom fails to warm us towards the
subject. On the whole, he understood the people well, and
they have well repaid him in understanding him better than
the critics have often done. The cobbler's droll humor, at
the opening of this play, followed as it is by a strain of the
loftiest poetry, is aptly noted by Campbell as showing that the
dramatist, "even in dealing with classical subjects, laughed
at the classic fear of putting the ludicrous and sublime into
juxtaposition."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><a name="General_Characteristics" id="General_Characteristics">IX. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS</a></h5>

<p>As a whole, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is inferior to <i>Coriolanus</i>, but it
abounds in scenes and passages fraught, with the highest
virtue of Shakespeare's genius. Among these may be specially
mentioned the second scene of the first act, where
Cassius sows the seed of the conspiracy in Brutus's mind,
warmed with such a wrappage of instigation as to assure
its effective germination; also the first scene of the second

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">liv</a></span>

act, unfolding the birth of the conspiracy, and winding up
with the interview, so charged with domestic glory, of Brutus
and Portia. The oration of Antony in C&aelig;sar's funeral is such
an interfusion of art and passion as realizes the very perfection
of its kind. Adapted at once to the comprehension of
the lowest mind and to the delectation of the highest, and
running its pathos into the very quick of them that hear
it, it tells with terrible effect on the people; and when it
is done we feel that C&aelig;sar's bleeding wounds are mightier
than ever his genius and fortune were. The quarrel of
Brutus and Cassius is deservedly celebrated. Dr. Johnson
thought it "somewhat cold and unaffecting." Coleridge
thought otherwise. See <a href="#noteIV_44">note, p. 123</a>. But there is nothing
in the play that is more divinely touched than the brief
scene, already noticed, of Brutus and his boy Lucius&mdash;so
gentle, so dutiful, so loving, so thoughtful and careful for
his master, and yet himself no more conscious of his virtue
than a flower of its fragrance. There is no more exquisite
passage in all Shakespeare than that which tells of the boy's
falling asleep in the midst of his song and exclaiming on
being aroused, "The strings, my lord, are false."</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

Professor W.W. Skeat's <i>Shakespeare's Plutarch</i> (The Macmillan
Company) gives these <i>Lives</i> in convenient form with a text
based upon the edition of 1612.</p>

<p><a name="noteIntro_2" id="noteIntro_2" href="#tagIntro_2">2</a>
A Latin translation of Plutarch's <i>Lives</i> was printed at Rome as
early as 1470, and there is evidence that through a Latin version
the work first attracted the attention of Amyot. But his famous
French version, first published in 1559, shows thorough familiarity
with the original Greek text.</p>

<p><a name="noteIntro_3" id="noteIntro_3" href="#tagIntro_3">3</a>
This title-page is given in facsimile as the <a href="#frontispiece">frontispiece</a> of this
volume.</p>

<p><a name="noteIntro_4" id="noteIntro_4" href="#tagIntro_4">4</a>
There is a famous copy of this edition in the Greenock Library
with the initials "W.S." at the top of the title-page and seventeenth
century manuscript notes in <i>The Life of Julius C&aelig;sar</i>. See
Skeat's <i>Shakespeare's Plutarch</i>, Introduction, p. xii.</p>

Reprinted in Collier's <i>Shakespeare's Library</i>. This translation
shows in more than one place the influence of Shakespeare's play.
For example, Hamlet's exclamation before he kills Polonius, "A rat!
a rat!" is in the English version, but there is no suggestion of it in
the French original.</p>

earlier date.</p>

<p><a name="noteIntro_19" id="noteIntro_19" href="#tagIntro_19">19</a>
Mr. F.G. Fleay in his Shakespeare Manual (1876) argues that
"this play as we have it is an abridgement of Shakespeare's play
made by Ben Jonson."</p>

"It must be understood that a play can be analyzed into very
different schemes of plot. It must not be thought that one of these
schemes is right and the rest wrong; but the schemes will be better
or worse in proportion as&mdash;while of course representing correctly
the facts of the play&mdash;they bring out more or less of what ministers
to our sense of design."&mdash;Moulton.</p>

Person&aelig;. His list was imperfect and Theobald enlarged it.</p>

<span class="charname">Antonius.</span> In <a href="#tagI_54">I, ii, 3</a>, 4, 6, the First Folio gives the name in the
Italian form, 'Antonio.' See <a href="#noteI_54">note, p. 9, l. 3.</a></p>

<p><a name="noteI_3" id="noteI_3" href="#tagI_3">I.3</a>
<span class="charname">Decius Brutus.</span> The true classical name was Decimus Brutus. In
Amyot's <i>Les Vies des hommes illustres grecs et latins</i> (1559) and in North's
Plutarch (1579) the name is given as in Shakespeare.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_4" id="noteI_4" href="#tagI_4">I.4</a>
<span class="charname">Marullus.</span> Theobald's emendation for the Murellus (Murrellus, <a href="#tagI_174">I, ii,
281</a>) of the First Folio. Marullus is the spelling in North's Plutarch.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_5" id="noteI_5" href="#tagI_5">I.5</a>
<span class="charname">Artemidorus.</span> Rowe (1709) had 'Artimedorus (Artemidorus, 1714)
a Soothsayer.' This Theobald altered to 'Artemidorus, a Sophist of Cnidos,'
and made the Soothsayer a separate character.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_6" id="noteI_6" href="#tagI_6">I.6</a>
<span class="charname">Calpurnia.</span> Occasionally in North's Plutarch (twice in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>)
and always in the First Folio the name is given as 'Calphurnia.'</p>

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> I. In the First Folio <i>The Tragedie of Julius C&aelig;sar</i> is
divided into acts but not into scenes, though 'Sc&oelig;na (so spelled in
the Folios) Prima' is given here after 'Actus Primus.'&mdash;<i>over the
stage</i>. This, the Folio stage direction, suggests a mob.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_9" id="noteI_9" href="#tagI_9">I.9</a>
<b>Being mechanical:</b> being mechanics. Shakespeare often uses
adjectives with the sense of plural substantives. Cf. 'subject' in
<i>Hamlet</i>, I, i, 72. Twice in North's Plutarch occurs "base mechanical
people."</p>

<p><a name="noteI_10" id="noteI_10" href="#tagI_10">I.10</a>
<b>ought not walk:</b> See Abbott, &sect; 349.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_11" id="noteI_11" href="#tagI_11">I.11</a>
Shakespeare transfers to ancient Rome the English customs
and usages of his own time. In Porter and Clarke's 'First Folio'
<i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, it is mentioned that Shakespeare's uncle Henry, a
farmer in Snitterfield, according to a court order of October 25,
1583, was fined "viii d for not havinge and wearinge cappes on Sondayes
and hollydayes."</p>

<b>cobbler</b>. This word was used of a coarse workman, or a
bungler, in any mechanical trade. So the Cobbler's answer does not
give the information required, though it contains a quibble.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_19" id="noteI_19" href="#tagI_19">I.19</a>
<b>soles</b>. The First Folio spelling, 'soules,' brings out the pun.
This 'immemorial quibble,' as Craik calls it, is found also in <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i>, IV, i, 123: "Not on thy sole, but on thy soul."</p>

Modern editors give this speech to Marullus, but the Folio
arrangement is more natural and dramatic, the two Tribunes alternately
rating the people, as Knight puts it, like two smiths smiting
on the same anvil.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_22" id="noteI_22" href="#tagI_22">I.22</a>
A quibble upon two common meanings of 'out'&mdash;(1) 'at

III, v, 34; and (2) as in 'out at heels,' or 'out at toes.'</p>

<p><a name="noteI_25" id="noteI_25" href="#tagI_25">I.25</a>
The text of the First Folio needs no emendation. It is good
prose and involves a neat pun.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_26" id="noteI_26" href="#tagI_26">I.26</a>
<b>proper:</b> goodly, handsome. This word has often this meaning
in Elizabethan literature, and is still so used in provincial England. Cf.
<i>The Tempest</i>, II, ii, 63; <i>Hebrews</i> (King James version), xi, 23; Burns's
<i>The Jolly Beggars</i>: "And still my delight is in proper young men."</p>

<p><a name="noteI_27" id="noteI_27" href="#tagI_27">I.27</a>
<b>trod upon neat's-leather</b>. This expression and "as proper a
man as" are repeated in the second scene of the second act of <i>The
Tempest</i>.&mdash;<b>neat's-leather</b>: ox-hide. 'Neat' is Anglo-Saxon <i>ne&aacute;t</i>,
'ox,' 'cow,' 'cattle,' and is still used in 'neat-herd,' 'neat's-foot oil.'
See <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, I, ii, 125. The form 'nowt' is still in common

The reference is to the great battle of Munda, in Spain, which
took place in March of the preceding year, <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> 45. C&aelig;sar was now
celebrating his fifth triumph, which was in honor of his final victory
over the Pompeian, or conservative, faction. Cn&aelig;us and Sextus,
the two sons of Pompey the Great, were leaders in that battle, and
Cn&aelig;us perished. "And because he had plucked up his race by the
roots, men did not think it meet for him to triumph so for the calamities
of his country."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>

"It is evident from the opening scene, that Shakespeare, even

represents the monosyllabic pronunciation of this word common in
the sixteenth century. In Shakespeare's verse the 'th' between two

<p><a name="noteI_45" id="noteI_45" href="#tagI_45">I.45</a>
<b>basest metal:</b> The Folio spelling is 'mettle,' and the word here
may connote 'spirit,' 'temper.' If it be taken literally, the reference
may be to 'lead.' Cf. 'base lead,' <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, II, ix, 19.
In this case the meaning may be that even these men, though as
dull and heavy as lead, have yet the sense to be tongue-tied with
shame at their conduct. 'Mettle' occurs again in <a href="#tagI_177">I, ii, 293</a>; 'metal'

<p><a name="noteI_47" id="noteI_47" href="#tagI_47">I.47</a>
<b>ceremonies:</b> ceremonial symbols, festal ornaments. Cf. 'trophies'
in l. 71 and 'scarfs' in <a href="#tagI_2_282">I, ii, 282</a>. Shakespeare employs the
word in the same way, as an abstract term used for the concrete
thing, in <i>Henry V</i>, IV, i, 109; and, in the singular, in <i>Measure for
Measure</i>, II, ii, 59. "After that, there were set up images of C&aelig;sar
in the city, with diadems on their heads like kings. Those the two
tribunes, Flavius and Marullus, went and pulled down."&mdash;Plutarch,
<i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_48" id="noteI_48" href="#tagI_48">I.48</a>
<b>Lupercal.</b> The <i>Lupercalia</i>, originally a shepherd festival, were
held in honor of Lupercus, the Roman Pan, on the 15th of February,
the month being named from <i>Februus</i>, a surname of the god. Lupercus
was, primarily, the god of shepherds, said to have been so
called because he protected the flocks from wolves. His wife Luperca
was the deified she-wolf that suckled Romulus. The festival,
in its original idea, was concerned with purification and fertilization.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_49" id="noteI_49" href="#tagI_49">I.49</a>
<b>C&aelig;sar's trophies.</b> These are the scarfs and badges mentioned

with which both actors and audience would be more familiar. So in
<a href="#tagIV_79">IV, iii, 102</a>, the Folios read "dearer than Pluto's (i.e. Plutus') mine."
Antonius was at this time Consul, as C&aelig;sar himself also was. Each
Roman <i>gens</i> had its own priesthood, and also its peculiar religious
rites. The priests of the Julian gens (so named from Iulus the son
of &AElig;neas) had lately been advanced to the same rank with those of
the god Lupercus; and Antony was at this time at their head. It
was probably as chief of the Julian Luperci that he officiated on this
occasion, stripped, as the old stage direction has it, "for the course."</p>

It was an old custom at these festivals for the priests, naked
except for a girdle about the loins, to run through the streets of
the city, waving in the hand a thong of goat's hide, and striking
with it such women as offered themselves for the blow, in the belief
that this would prevent or avert "the sterile curse." C&aelig;sar was at
this time childless; his only daughter, Julia, married to Pompey
the Great, having died some years before, upon the birth of her first
child, who also died soon after.</p>

Coleridge has a remark on this line, which, whether true to

Caius Cassius Longinus had married Junia, a sister of Brutus.
Both had lately stood for the chief pr&aelig;torship of the city, and
Brutus, through C&aelig;sar's favor, had won it; though Cassius was
at the same time elected one of the sixteen pr&aelig;tors or judges of
the city. This is said to have produced a coldness between Brutus
and Cassius, so that they did not speak to each other, till this
extraordinary flight of patriotism brought them together.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_73" id="noteI_73" href="#tagI_73">I.73</a>
<b>behaviours.</b>
Shakespeare often uses abstract nouns in the plural. This usage is
common in Carlyle. Here, however, and elsewhere in Shakespeare,
as in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, II, iii, 100, the plural 'behaviours'
may be regarded as denoting the particular acts which make up what
we call 'behavior.' See Clar.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_74" id="noteI_74" href="#tagI_74">I.74</a>
<b>mistook.</b> The <i>en</i> of the termination of the past participle of
strong verbs is often dropped, and when the resulting word might
be mistaken for the infinitive, the form of the past tense is frequently
substituted.</p>

<p><a name="noteI_75" id="noteI_75" href="#tagI_75">I.75</a>
<b>passion.</b> Shakespeare uses 'passion' for any
feeling, sentiment, or emotion, whether painful or pleasant. So in

<p><a name="noteI_76" id="noteI_76" href="#tagI_76">I.76</a>

In Elizabethan literature 'fever' is often used for sickness
in general as well as for what is now specifically called a fever.
C&aelig;sar had three several campaigns in Spain at different periods of
his life, and the text does not show which of these Shakespeare
had in mind. One passage in Plutarch indicates that C&aelig;sar was first
taken with the 'falling-sickness' during his third campaign, which
closed with the great battle of Munda, March 17, <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> 45. See <a href="#noteI_159">note,

and delicate make; and his countenance, as we have it in authentic
busts, is of almost feminine beauty. Cicero, who did not love him
at all, in one of his <i>Letters</i> applies to him the Greek word that is
used for 'miracle' or 'wonder' in the New Testament; the English
of the passage being, "This miracle (monster?) is a thing of terrible
energy, swiftness, diligence."</p>


<p><a name="noteI_117" id="noteI_117" href="#tagI_117">I.117</a>
Observe the force of 'narrow' here; as if C&aelig;sar were grown
so enormously big that even the world seemed a little thing under
him. Some while before this, the Senate had erected a bronze
statue of C&aelig;sar, standing on a globe, and inscribed to "C&aelig;sar the
Demigod," but this inscription C&aelig;sar erased.</p>

It is only a legend that the bronze Colossus of Rhodes
bestrode the entrance to the famous harbor. The story probably
arose from the statement that the figure, which represented Helios,
the national deity of the Rhodians, was so high that a ship might
sail between its legs.</p>

In Shakespeare are many such allusions to the tenets of the
old astrology and the belief in planetary influence upon the fortunes
and characters of men which Scott describes in the Introduction to

<b>the great flood.</b> By this an ancient Roman would understand

<p><a name="noteI_124" id="noteI_124" href="#tagI_124">I.124</a>
<b>walks.</b> The reasons why Rowe's emendation, 'walls,' is
almost universally accepted, are that 'walls' would be easily corrupted
into 'walks' from the nearness of 'talk'd,' and that there is
a disagreeable assonance in 'talk'd' and 'walks' in successive lines.
But 'walks' is picturesque and poetical; compared with it, 'walls'
is commonplace and obvious. Cf. <i>Paradise Lost</i>, IV, 586.</p>

A play upon 'Rome' and 'room,' which appear to have been
sounded more alike in Shakespeare's time than they are now. So
again in <a href="#tagIII_100">III, i, 289-290</a>: "A dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety

The allusion is to Lucius Junius Brutus, who bore a leading
part in driving out the Tarquins and in turning the kingdom into a
republic. Afterwards, as consul, he condemned his own sons to
death for attempting to restore the kingdom. The Marcus Junius
Brutus of the play, according to Plutarch, supposed himself to be
descended from him. His mother, Servilia, also derived her lineage
from Servilius Ahala, who slew Spurius M&aelig;lius for aspiring to
royalty. Merivale remarks that "the name of Brutus forced its possessor
into prominence as soon as royalty began to be discussed."</p>

<b>eternal.</b> Johnson suggested 'infernal.' Dr. Wright (Clar.)
points out that in three plays printed in 1600 Shakespeare uses
'infernal,' but substitutes 'eternal' in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, and
<i>Othello</i>, in obedience probably to the popular Puritan agitation
against profanity on the stage. This has been used as evidence
to determine dates of composition. See Introduction, page xx. Cf.
with this use of 'eternal' the old Yankee term 'tarnal' in such expressions
as 'tarnal scamp,' 'tarnal shame,' etc.</p>

One of the marked physical characteristics of the albinotic
ferret is the red or pink eye. Shakespeare turns the noun 'ferret'
into an adjective. The description of Cicero is purely imaginary;
but the angry spot on C&aelig;sar's brow, Calpurnia's pale cheek, and
Cicero with fire in his eyes when kindled by opposition in the Senate,
make an exceedingly vivid picture.</p>

"Another time when C&aelig;sar's friends complained unto
him of Antonius and Dolabella, that they pretended some mischief
towards him, he answered them again, As for those fat men, and
smooth-combed heads, quoth he, I never reckon of them; but these
pale visaged and carrion lean people, I fear them most; meaning
Brutus and Cassius."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>. There are similar
passages in Plutarch's <i>Life of Brutus</i> and in the <i>Life of Marcus
Antonius</i>. Cf. <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, III, xi, 37. Falstaff's famous
cry was for 'spare men.' See <i>2 Henry IV</i>, III, ii, 288. 'Sleek-headed'

The power of music is repeatedly celebrated by Shakespeare,
and sometimes in strains that approximate the classical hyperboles
about Orpheus, Amphion, and Arion. What is here said of Cassius
has an apt commentary in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, V, 1, 83-85:</p>

<div class="poem">

A charming invention, though in his <i>Life of Cicero</i> Plutarch
refers to the orator's nicknames, 'Grecian' and 'scholer,' due
to his ability to "declaim in Greek." Cicero had a sharp, agile
tongue, and was fond of using it; and nothing was more natural
than that he should snap off some keen, sententious sayings, prudently
veiling them, however, in a foreign language from all but

<b>humour.</b> To 'humor' a man, as the word is here used, is to
turn and wind and manage him by watching his moods and crotchets,
and to touch him accordingly. It is somewhat in doubt whether
the 'he' in the preceding line refers to Brutus or to C&aelig;sar. If to
Brutus, the meaning of course is: he should not play upon my
humors and fancies as I do upon his. And this sense is fairly
required by the context, for the whole speech is occupied with the
speaker's success in cajoling Brutus, and with plans for cajoling and
shaping him still further. Johnson refers 'he' to C&aelig;sar.</p>

<b>any thing more wonderful.</b> This may be interpreted as 'anything
that was more wonderful,' or 'anything more that was wonderful.'
The former seems the true interpretation. For the 'wonderful' things
that Casca describes, Shakespeare was indebted to the following
passage from Plutarch's <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, which North in the margin
entitles "Predictions and foreshews of C&aelig;sar's death": "Certainly
destiny may easier be foreseen than avoided, considering the strange
and wonderful signs that were said to be seen before C&aelig;sar's death.
For, touching the fires in the element, and spirits running up and
down in the night, and also the solitary birds to be seen at noondays
sitting in the great market-place, are not all these signs perhaps
worth the noting, in such a wonderful chance as happened? But
Strabo the philosopher writeth, that divers men were seen going up
and down in fire, and furthermore, that there was a slave of the
soldiers that did cast a marvellous burning flame out of his hand,
insomuch as they that saw it thought he had been burnt; but when
the fire was out, it was found he had no hurt. C&aelig;sar self also,
doing sacrifice unto the gods, found that one of the beasts which
was sacrificed had no heart: and that was a strange thing in nature,
how a beast could live without a heart." This passage is worth
special attention, as Shakespeare uses many of the details again in
<a href="#tagII_144">II, ii, 17-24</a>, 39-40. Cf. <i>Hamlet</i>, I, i, 113-125.</p>

in Middle English in the sense of 'shine brilliantly,' and Dr.
Wright (Clar) says: "I am informed by a correspondent that the
word 'glaze' in the sense of 'stare' is common in some parts of
Devonshire, and that 'glazing like a conger' is a familiar expression

Casca refers to the doctrine of the Epicureans, who were slow to
believe that such pranks of the elements had any moral significance
in them, or that moral causes had anything to do with them, and
held that the explanation of them was to be sought for in the
simple working of natural laws and forces. Shakespeare deals

ll. 63-68 The construction here is involved, and the grammar confused,

monstrous or unnatural modes of action.</p>

There seems no necessity for changing the reading of the

state' occurs with probably the same general meaning in <i>King Lear</i>, II,
ii, 176. As Cassius is an avowed Epicurean, it may seem out of character
to make him speak thus. But he is here talking for effect, his aim
being to kindle and instigate Casca into the conspiracy; and to this
end he does not hesitate to say what he does not himself believe.</p>

This reads as if a lion were kept in the Capitol. But the
meaning probably is that C&aelig;sar roars in the Capitol, like a lion.
Perhaps Cassius has the idea of C&aelig;sar's claiming or aspiring to be
among men what the lion is among beasts. Dr. Wright suggests that
Shakespeare had in mind the lions kept in the Tower of London,
"which there is reason to believe from indications in the play represented
the Capitol to Shakespeare's mind." It is possible, too, that
we have here a reference to the lion described by Casca in <a href="#tagI_3_20">ll. 20-22</a>.</p>

The idea seems to be that, as men start a huge fire with
worthless straws or shavings, so C&aelig;sar is using the degenerate Romans
of the time to set the whole world a-blaze with his own glory.
Cassius's enthusiastic hatred of "the mightiest Julius" is irresistibly
delightful. For a good hater is the next best thing to a true friend;
and Cassius's honest gushing malice is surely better than Brutus's
stabbing sentimentalism.</p>

<b>Pompey's porch.</b> This was a spacious adjunct to the huge
theater that Pompey had built in the Campus Martius, outside of

"was set up the image of Pompey, which the city had made and
consecrated in honour of him, when he did beautify that part of the
city with the theatre he built, with divers porches about it." Here
it was that C&aelig;sar was stabbed to death; and though Shakespeare
transfers the assassination to the Capitol, he makes C&aelig;sar's blood

Brutus has been casting about on all sides to find some means

<b>Remorse.</b> Constantly in Shakespeare 'remorse' is used for
'pity' or 'compassion.' Here it seems to mean something more,
'conscience,' 'conscientiousness.' So in <i>Othello</i>, III, iii, 468:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="indent3">Let him command,</p>
<p>And to obey shall be in me remorse,</p>
<p>What bloody business ever.</p>
</div>

<p>The possession of dictatorial power is apt to stifle or sear the conscience,
so as to make a man literally remorseless.</p>

ll. 29-34 The general meaning
of this somewhat obscure passage is, Since we have no show
or pretext of a cause, no assignable ground or apparent ground of
complaint, against C&aelig;sar, in what he is, or in anything he has yet
done, let us assume that the further addition of a crown will quite
upset his nature, and metamorphose him into a serpent. The strain
of casuistry used in this speech is very remarkable. Coleridge
found it perplexing. On the supposition that Shakespeare meant
Brutus for a wise and good man, the speech seems unintelligible.
But Shakespeare must have regarded him simply as a well-meaning
but conceited and shallow idealist; and such men are always cheating
and puffing themselves with the thinnest of sophisms, feeding
on air and conceiving themselves inspired, or "mistaking the
giddiness of the head for the illumination of the Spirit."</p>

The Folio reading 'first of March' cannot be right
chronologically, though it is undoubtedly what Shakespeare wrote, for in
Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>, he read: "Cassius asked him if he were
determined to be in the Senate-house the first day of the month of
March, because he heard say that C&aelig;sar's friends should move the
Council that day that C&aelig;sar should be called king by the Senate."
This inconsistency is not without parallels in Shakespeare. Cf. the
"four strangers" in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, I, ii, 135, when six have
been mentioned. In Scott, too, are many such inconsistencies.</p>

<p><a name="noteII_25" id="noteII_25" href="#tagII_25">II.25</a>
<b>exhalations</b>: meteors. In Plutarch's <i>Opinions of Philosophers</i>,
Holland's translation, is this passage (spelling modernized): "Aristotle
supposeth that all these meteors come of a dry exhalation,
which, being gotten enclosed within a moist cloud, seeketh means,
and striveth forcibly to get forth." Shakespeare uses 'meteor'
repeatedly in the same way. So in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, III, v, 13.</p>

Commentators differ about 'Genius' here; some taking it for
the 'conscience,' others for the 'anti-conscience.' Shakespeare uses
'genius,' 'spirit,' and 'demon,' as synonymous, and all three, apparently,
both in a good sense and in a bad, as every man was supposed
to have a good and a bad angel. So, in this play, <a href="#tagIV_3_282">IV, iii, 282</a>, we
have "thy evil spirit"; in <i>The Tempest</i>, IV, i, 27, "our worser
genius"; in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, IV, iv, 52, "some say the Genius
so Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die"; in <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i>, II, iii, 19, "Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee";
where, as often, 'keeps' is 'guards.' In these and some other cases
the words have some epithet or context that determines their meaning,
but not so with 'Genius' in the text. But, in all such cases,
the words indicate the directive power of the mind. And so we
often speak of a man's 'better self,' or a man's 'worser self,'
according as one is in fact directed or drawn to good or to evil.&mdash;The
sense of 'mortal' here is also somewhat in question.
Shakespeare sometimes uses it for 'perishable,' or that which dies; but
oftener for 'deadly,' or that which kills. 'Mortal instruments' may
well be held to mean what Macbeth refers to when he says, "I'm
settled, and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat."&mdash;As
Brutus is speaking with reference to his own case, he probably
intends 'Genius' in a good sense, for the spiritual or immortal part
of himself. If so, then he would naturally mean by 'mortal' his
perishable part, or his ministerial faculties, which shrink from executing
what the directing power is urging them to. The late Professor
Ferrier of St. Andrews seems to take a somewhat different view
of the passage. He says, "In this speech of Brutus, Shakespeare
gives a fine description of the unsettled state of the mind when the
will is hesitating about the perpetration of a great crime, and when
the passions are threatening to overpower, and eventually do overpower,
the reason and the conscience."</p>

ll. 101-111 This little side-talk on a theme so different from the
main one of the scene, is finely conceived, and aptly marks the
men as seeking to divert anxious thoughts of the moment by any
casual chat. It also serves the double purpose of showing that they
are not listening, and of preventing suspicion if any were listening
to them. In itself it is thoroughly Shakespearian; and the description
of the dawn-light flecking the clouds takes high place among
Shakespeare's great sky pictures.</p>

any caution or assurance, nor binding themselves one to another by
any religious oaths, they all kept the matter so secret to themselves,
and could so cunningly handle it, that notwithstanding the gods did

gives it a more colloquial cast, without causing any real obscurity.

dialogue is very charming. Brutus knows full well that Cicero is
not the man to take a subordinate position; that if he have anything
to do with the enterprise it must be as the leader of it; and
that is just what Brutus wants to be himself. Merivale thinks it a
great honor to Cicero that the conspirators did not venture to propose
the matter to him. In Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>, the attitude
of the conspirators to Cicero is described thus: "For this cause
they durst not acquaint Cicero with their conspiracy, although he
was a man whom they loved dearly and trusted best; for they were
afraid that he, being a coward by nature, and age also having increased
his fear, he would quite turn and alter all their purpose,
and quench the heat of their enterprise (the which specially required
hot and earnest execution), seeking by persuasion to bring all things
to such safety, as there should be no peril."</p>

'Main' is often found in sixteenth century literature in the sense
of 'great,' 'strong,' 'mighty.' C&aelig;sar was, in his philosophy, an Epicurean,
like most of the educated Romans of the time. Hence he
was, in opinion, strongly skeptical about dreams and ceremonial
auguries. But his conduct, especially in his later years, was characterized
by many gross instances of superstitious practice.</p>

Bears are said to have been caught by putting looking-glasses
in their way; they being so taken with the images of themselves
that the hunters could easily master them. Elephants were beguiled
into pitfalls, lightly covered over with hurdles and turf.</p>

<b>toils:</b> nets, snares. The root idea of the word is a 'thing
woven' (Cf. Spenser's 'welwoven toyles' in <i>Astrophel</i>, xvii, 1), and
while it seems to have primary reference to a web or cord spread
for taking prey, the old Fr. <i>toile</i> sometimes means a 'stalking-horse
of painted canvas.' Shakespeare uses the word several times. Cf.
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, V, ii, 351; <i>Hamlet</i>, III, ii, 362.</p>

there was one called Caius Ligarius, who had been accused unto
C&aelig;sar for taking part with Pompey, and C&aelig;sar discharged him.
But Ligarius thanked not C&aelig;sar so much for his discharge, as he
was offended with him for that he was brought in danger by his
tyrannical power: and therefore in his heart he was always his mortal
enemy, and was besides very familiar with Brutus, who went
to see him being sick in his bed, and said unto him: 'Ligarius, in
what a time art thou sick?' Ligarius, rising up in his bed, and
taking him by the right hand, said unto him: 'Brutus,' said he,
'if thou hast any great enterprise in hand, worthy of thyself, I

The compound epithet, 'honey-heavy,' is very expressive
and apt. The 'dew of slumber' is called 'heavy' because it makes
the subject feel heavy, and 'honey-heavy,' because the heaviness it
induces is sweet. But there may be a reference to the old belief that
the bee gathered its honey from falling dew. So in Vergil's <i>Georgics</i>,
IV, i, we have "the heavenly gifts of honey born in air." Brutus is
naturally led to contrast the free and easy state of the boy's mind
with that of his own, which the excitement of his present undertaking
is drawing full of visions and images of trouble.</p>

Similarities and differences between this scene with Brutus
and Portia and that between Hotspur and his wife in <i>1 King Henry IV</i>,
II, iii, will prove a suggestive study. The description of the development
of Portia's suspicion here is taken directly from Plutarch. "Out
of his house he (Brutus) did so frame and fashion his countenance
and looks that no man could discern he had anything to trouble his
mind. But when night came that he was in his own house, then he
was clean changed: for either care did wake him against his will
when he would have slept, or else oftentimes of himself he fell into
such deep thoughts of this enterprise, casting in his mind all the
dangers that might happen: that his wife, lying by him, found that
there was some marvellous great matter that troubled his mind, not
being wont to be in that taking, and that he could not well determine
with himself."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

<b>humour:</b> moody caprice. The word comes to have this
meaning from the theory of the old physiologists that four cardinal
humors&mdash;blood, choler or yellow bile, phlegm, and melancholy or
black bile&mdash;determine, by their conditions and proportions, a person's
physical and mental qualities. The influence of this theory
survives in the application of the terms 'sanguine,' 'choleric,'
'phlegmatic,' and 'melancholy' to disposition and temperament.</p>

<p><a name="noteII_110" id="noteII_110" href="#tagII_110">II.110</a>

I, ii, 143: "If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion
of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me."  Cf. the
term 'ill-conditioned,' still in use to describe an irascible or quarrelsome
disposition. In l. 236 'condition' refers to bodily health.</p>

fluids that issue from the eyes or mouth. So in <i>Hamlet</i>, II, ii, 529,

This speech, and that beginning with l. 291, follow Plutarch
very closely: "His wife Porcia<a class="tag" name="tagII_119_1" id="tagII_119_1" href="#noteII_119_1">[1]</a> ... was the daughter of Cato,
whom Brutus married being his cousin, not a maiden, but a young
widow after the death of her first husband Bibulus, by whom she had
also a young son called Bibulus, who afterwards wrote a book of
the acts and gests of Brutus .... This young lady, being excellently
well seen<a class="tag" name="tagII_119_2" id="tagII_119_2" href="#noteII_119_2">[2]</a> in philosophy, loving her husband well, and being of a
noble courage, as she was also wise: because she would not ask
her husband what he ailed before she had made some proof by her
self: she took a little razor, such as barbers occupy to pare men's
nails, and, causing her maids and women to go out of her chamber,
gave herself a great gash withal in her thigh, that she was straight
all of a gore blood: and incontinently after a vehement fever took
her, by reason of the pain of her wound. Then perceiving her husband
was marvellously out of quiet, and that he could take no rest,
even in her greatest pain of all she spake in this sort unto him: 'I
being, O Brutus,' said she, 'the daughter of Cato, was married
unto thee; not to be thy bed-fellow and companion in bed and at
board only, like a harlot, but to be partaker also with thee of thy
good and evil fortune. Now for thyself, I can find no cause of fault
in thee touching our match: but for my part, how may I shew my
duty towards thee and how much I would do for thy sake; if I cannot
constantly bear a secret mischance or grief with thee, which
requireth secrecy and fidelity? I confess that a woman's wit
commonly is too weak to keep a secret safely: but yet, Brutus, good
education, and the company of virtuous men, have some power to
reform the defect of nature. And for my self, I have this benefit
moreover, that I am the daughter of Cato, and wife of Brutus.
This notwithstanding, I did not trust to any of these things before,
until that now I have found by experience, that no pain or grief
whatsoever can overcome me.' With those words she shewed him
her wound on her thigh, and told him what she had done to prove
herself. Brutus was amazed to hear what she said unto him, and
lifting up his hands to heaven, he besought the gods to give him the
grace he might bring his enterprise to so good pass, that he might
be found a husband, worthy of so noble a wife as Porcia: so he then
did comfort her the best he could."&mdash;<i>Marcus Brutus.</i></p>

This embodies what was known about the circulation of
the blood at the close of the sixteenth century. In 1616, the year
of Shakespeare's death, William Harvey, born in 1578, lectured on
his great discovery, but his celebrated treatise was not published
until 1628. The general fact of the circulation was known in ancient
times, and Harvey's discovery lay in ascertaining the <i>modus operandi</i>
of it, and in reducing it to matter of strict science.</p>

In Plutarch the scene is thus graphically described: "Then
going to bed the same night, as his manner was, and lying with his
wife Calpurnia, all the windows and doors of his chamber flying
open, the noise awoke him, and made him afraid when he saw such
light; but more, when he heard his wife Calpurnia, being fast asleep,
weep and sigh, and put forth many fumbling lamentable speeches:
for she dreamed that C&aelig;sar was slain.... C&aelig;sar rising in the morning,
she prayed him, if it were possible, not to go out of the doors that
day, but to adjourn the session of the Senate until another day. And
if that he made no reckoning of her dream, yet that he would search
further of the soothsayers by their sacrifices, to know what should
happen him that day. Thereby it seemed that C&aelig;sar did likewise fear
or suspect somewhat, because his wife Calpurnia until that time was
never given to any fear and superstition; and that then he saw her so
troubled in mind with this dream she had. But much more afterwards,
when the soothsayers having sacrificed many beasts one after another,
told him that none did like<a class="tag" name="tagII_141_1" id="tagII_141_1" href="#noteII_141_1">[1]</a> them: then he determined to send Antonius

given as his reason for refusing a guard, that he thought Rome had
more need of him than he of Rome. "And the very day before,
C&aelig;sar, supping with Marcus Lepidus, sealed certain letters, as he
was wont to do, at the board: so, talk falling out amongst them,

In Shakespeare's time 'statue' was pronounced indifferently

as a trisyllable, and spells it 'statua,' as in his <i>Advancement of Learning</i>:

In ancient times, when martyrs or other distinguished men
were executed, their friends often pressed to stain handkerchiefs
with their blood, or to get some other relic, which they might keep,
either as precious memorials of them, or as having a kind of sacramental
virtue. 'Cognizance' is here used in a heraldic sense, meaning
any badge to show whose friends the wearers were.</p>

The Roman people were specially yearning to avenge the
slaughter of Marcus Crassus and his army by the Parthians, and
C&aelig;sar was at this time preparing an expedition against them. But
a Sibylline oracle was alleged, that Parthia could only be conquered
by a king; and it was proposed to invest C&aelig;sar with the royal title
and authority over the foreign subjects of the state. It is agreed on
all hands that, if his enemies did not originate this proposal, they at
least craftily urged it on, in order to make him odious, and exasperate
the people against him. To the same end, they had for some
time been plying the arts of extreme sycophancy, heaping upon him
all possible honors, human and divine, hoping thereby to kindle
such a fire of envy as would consume him.</p>

Plutarch thus describes the scene: "But in the mean time
Decius Brutus, surnamed Albinus, in whom C&aelig;sar put such confidence,
that in his last will and testament he had appointed him to
be his next heir, and yet was of the conspiracy with Cassius and
Brutus: he, fearing that if C&aelig;sar did adjourn the session that day,
the conspiracy would be betrayed, laughed at the soothsayers, and
reproved C&aelig;sar, saying, 'that he gave the Senate occasion to mislike
with him, and that they might think he mocked them, considering
that by his commandment they were assembled, and that they
were ready willingly to grant him all things, and to proclaim him
king of all his provinces of the Empire of Rome out of Italy, and
that he should wear his diadem in all other places both by sea and
land. And furthermore, that if any man should tell them from him
they should depart for that present time, and return again when
Calpurnia should have better dreams, what would his enemies and
ill-willers say, and how could they like of his friends' words? And
who could persuade them otherwise, but that they should think his
dominion a slavery unto them and tyrannical in himself? And yet
if it be so,' said he, 'that you utterly mislike of this day, it is better
that you go yourself in person, and, saluting the Senate, to dismiss
them till another time.' Therewithal he took C&aelig;sar by the hand,
and brought him out of his house."&mdash;<i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>

This is a graphic and charming touch. Here, for the first
time, we have C&aelig;sar speaking fairly in character; for he was probably
the most finished gentleman of his time, one of the sweetest
of men, and as full of kindness as of wisdom and courage. Merivale
aptly styles him "C&aelig;sar the politic and the merciful."</p>

The winning and honest suavity of C&aelig;sar here starts a
pang of remorse in Brutus. Drinking wine together was regarded
as a sacred pledge of truth and honor. Brutus knows that C&aelig;sar
is doing it in good faith; and it hurts him to think that the others
seem to be doing the like, and yet are doing a very different thing.</p>

every little noise and cry she heard, as those that are taken and

So in Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>: "Another senator called
Popilius L&aelig;na after he had saluted Brutus and Cassius more friendly
than he was wont to do, he rounded<a class="tag" name="tagIII_13_1" id="tagIII_13_1" href="#noteIII_13_1">[1]</a> softly in their ears, and told
them, 'I pray the gods you may go through with that you have
taken in hand; but, withal, dispatch, I read<a class="tag" name="tagIII_13_2" id="tagIII_13_2" href="#noteIII_13_2">[2]</a> you, for your enterprise
is bewrayed.' When he had said, he presently departed from them,
and left them both afraid that their conspiracy would out....
When C&aelig;sar came out of his litter, Popilius L&aelig;na went ... and
kept him a long time with a talk. C&aelig;sar gave good ear unto him;
wherefore the conspirators ... conjecturing ... that his talk was
none other but the very discovery of their conspiracy, they were
afraid every man of them; and one looking in another's face, it was
easy to see that they all were of a mind, that it was no tarrying for
them till they were apprehended, but rather that they should kill
themselves with their own hands. And when Cassius and certain
other clapped their hands on their swords under their gowns, to
draw them, Brutus marking the countenance and gesture of L&aelig;na,
and considering that he did use himself rather like an humble and
earnest suitor than like an accuser, he said nothing to his companion
(because there were many amongst them that were not of the conspiracy),
but with a pleasant countenance encouraged Cassius; and
immediately after, L&aelig;na went from C&aelig;sar, and kissed his hand....
Trebonius on the other side drew Antonius aside, as he came into the
house where the Senate sat, and held him with a long talk without."
In the <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> Plutarch makes Decius detain Antony in talk.</p>

In previous editions of Hudson's Shakespeare was adopted,
with a slight change, Tyrwhitt's suggested restoration of these lines
to the form indicated by Ben Jonson in the famous passage in his
<i>Discoveries</i>, when, speaking of Shakespeare, he says: "Many times
he fell into those things could not escape laughter: as when he
said in the person of C&aelig;sar, one speaking to him, 'C&aelig;sar, thou
dost me wrong,' he replied, 'C&aelig;sar did never wrong but with just
cause,' and such like; which were ridiculous." Based upon this
note the Tyrwhitt restoration of the text was:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><span class="charname">Metellus.</span> C&aelig;sar, thou dost me wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<p><span class="charname">C&aelig;sar.</span> Know, C&aelig;sar doth not wrong, but with just cause,</p>
<p>Nor without cause will he be satisfied.</p>
</div>

<p>In the old Hudson Shakespeare text the first line of C&aelig;sar's reply
was: "C&aelig;sar did never wrong but with just cause." Jonson has
another gird at what he deemed Shakespeare's blunder, for in the
Induction to <i>The Staple of News</i> is, "<i>Prologue</i>. Cry you mercy, you
never did wrong, but with just cause." Either Jonson must have
misquoted what he heard at the theater, or the passage was altered
to the form in the text of the Folios on his remonstrance. This way
of conveying meanings by suggestion rather than direct expression
was intolerable to Jonson. Jonson must have known that 'wrong'
could mean 'injury' and 'punishment' as well as 'wrong-doing.'

of character, and in a strain of hateful arrogance, in order, apparently,
to soften the enormity of his murder, and to grind the daggers
of the assassins to a sharper point. Perhaps, also, it is a part of
the irony which so marks this play, to put the haughtiest words in
C&aelig;sar's mouth just before his fall.</p>

<b>Et tu, Brute?</b> There is no classical authority for putting this
phrase into the mouth of C&aelig;sar. It seems to have been an Elizabethan
proverb or 'gag,' and it is found in at least three works
published earlier than <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>. (See Introduction, Sources,
<a href="#Page_xvi">p. xvi</a>.) C&aelig;sar had been as a father to Brutus, who was fifteen
years his junior; and the Greek, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#8058;, &#964;&#8051;&#954;&#957;&#959;&#957; "and thou, my
son!" which Dion and Suetonius put into his mouth, though probably
unauthentic, is good enough to be true. In Plutarch are two
detailed accounts of the assassination, that in <i>Marcus Brutus</i> differing
somewhat from that in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> with regard to the
nomenclature of the persons involved. The following is from <i>Marcus
Brutus</i>: "Trebonius on the other side drew Antonius aside, as he
came into the house where the Senate sat, and held him with a long
talk without. When C&aelig;sar was come into the house, all the Senate
rose to honour him at his coming in. So when he was set, the conspirators
flocked about him, and amongst them they presented one
Tullius Cimber, who made humble suit for the calling home again
of his brother that was banished. They all made as though they
were intercessors for him, and took C&aelig;sar by the hands, and kissed
his head and breast. C&aelig;sar at the first simply refused their kindness
and entreaties; but afterwards, perceiving they still pressed on him,
he violently thrust them from him. Then Cimber with both his
hands plucked C&aelig;sar's gown over his shoulders, and Casca, that
stood behind him, drew his dagger first and strake C&aelig;sar upon the
shoulder, but gave him no great wound. C&aelig;sar, feeling himself hurt,
took him straight by the hand he held his dagger in, and cried out
in Latin: 'O traitor Casca, what dost thou?' Casca on the other
side cried in Greek, and called his brother to help him. So divers
running on a heap together to fly upon C&aelig;sar, he, looking about
him to have fled, saw Brutus with a sword drawn in his hand ready
to strike at him: then he let Casca's hand go, and casting his gown
over his face, suffered every man to strike at him that would. Then
the conspirators thronging one upon another, because every man was
desirous to have a cut at him, so many swords and daggers lighting
upon one body, one of them hurt another, and among them Brutus

from the text of the Folios. In the light of Casca's sentiments expressed
in <a href="#tagI_235">I, iii, 100-102</a>, this speech is more characteristic of him

ll. 117-119: This speech and the two preceding, vaingloriously anticipating
the stage celebrity of the deed, are very strange; and, unless
there be a shrewd irony lurking in them, it is hard to understand
the purpose of them. Their effect is to give a very ambitious air to
the work of these professional patriots, and to cast a highly theatrical
color on their alleged virtue, as if they had sought to immortalize
themselves by "striking the foremost man of all this world."</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_56" id="noteIII_56" href="#tagIII_56">III.56</a>
<b>resolv'd</b>: informed. This meaning is probably connected
with the primary one of 'loosen,' 'set free,' through the idea of
setting free from perplexity. 'Resolve' continued to be used in
the sense of 'inform' and 'answer' until the beginning of the nineteenth
century. Shakespeare uses the word in the three main
senses of (1) 'relax,' 'dissolve,' <i>Hamlet</i>, I, ii, 130; (2) 'inform,' as
here; and (3) 'determine,' <i>3 Henry VI</i>, III, iii, 219.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_57" id="noteIII_57" href="#tagIII_57">III.57</a>
<b>Thorough</b>. Shakespeare uses 'through' or 'thorough' indifferently,
as suits his verse. The two are but different forms of the

has overtopped his equals, and grown too high for the public safety.
So in the speech of Oliver in <i>As You Like It</i>, I, i, 90, when incensed
at the high bearing of Orlando: "Is it even so? begin you to grow

<p><a name="noteIII_65" id="noteIII_65" href="#tagIII_65">III.65</a>
The first 'fire' is dissyllabic. The allusion is to the old
notion that if a burn be held to the fire the pain will be drawn or
driven out. Shakespeare has four other very similar allusions to this
belief&mdash;<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, I, ii, 46; <i>Coriolanus</i>, IV, vii, 54; <i>The Two
Gentlemen of Verona</i>, II, iv, 192; <i>King John</i>, III, i, 277.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_66" id="noteIII_66" href="#tagIII_66">III.66</a>
<b>in strength of malice:</b> strong as they have shown themselves
to be in malice towards tyranny. Though the Folio text may be
corrupt, and at least twelve emendations have been suggested,
the figure as it stands is intelligible, though elliptically obscure.
Grant White has indicated how thoroughly the expression is in the
spirit of what Brutus has just said. In previous editions of Hudson's
Shakespeare, Singer's conjecture of 'amity' for 'malice' was
adopted. What makes this conjecture plausible is Shakespeare's
frequent use of 'amity,' and "strength of their amity" occurs in
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, II, vi, 137.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_67" id="noteIII_67" href="#tagIII_67">III.67</a>
Brutus has been talking about "our hearts," and "kind
love, good thoughts, and reverence." To Cassius, all that is mere
rose-water humbug, and he knows it is so to Antony too. He hastens
to put in such motives as he knows will have weight with Antony,
as they also have with himself. And it is remarkable that several
of these patriots, especially Cassius, the two Brutuses, and Trebonius,
afterwards accepted the governorship of fat provinces for
which they had been prospectively named by C&aelig;sar.</p>

"When C&aelig;sar was slain, the Senate&mdash;though Brutus stood

as some did shut to the doors."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>

for the plain, direct 'limbs' of the Folios. One of Johnson's
suggestions was "these lymmes," taking 'lymmes' in the sense of
'lime-hounds,' i.e. 'leash-hounds.' 'Lym' is on the list of dogs in
<i>King Lear</i>, III, vi, 72. In defence of the Folio text Dr. Wright
quotes Timon's curse on the senators of Athens and says, "Lear's
curses were certainly levelled at his daughter's limbs."</p>

'Havoc' was anciently the word of signal for giving no
quarter in a battle. It was a high crime for any one to give the signal
without authority from the general in chief; hence the peculiar
force of 'monarch's voice.'&mdash;To 'let slip' a dog was a term of the
chase, for releasing the hounds from the 'slip' or leash of leather
whereby they were held in hand till it was time to let them pursue
the animal.&mdash;The 'dogs of war' are fire, sword, and famine. So in

"The rest followed in troupe, but Brutus went foremost, very

although they were a multitude of rakehels of all sorts, and had a
good will to make some stir; yet, being ashamed to do it, for the

ll. 43-46 In this speech Shakespeare seems to have aimed at imitating
the manner actually ascribed to Brutus. "In some of his Epistles, he
counterfeited that brief compendious manner of speech of the Laced&aelig;monians."&mdash;Plutarch,
<i>Marcus Brutus</i>. Shakespeare's idea is
sustained by the <i>Dialogus de Oratoribus</i>, ascribed to Tacitus, wherein
it is said that Brutus's style of eloquence was censured as <i>otiosum et
disjunctum</i>. Verplanck remarks, "the <i>disjunctum</i>, the broken-up style,
without oratorical continuity, is precisely that assumed by the dramatist."
Gollancz finds a probable original of this speech in Belleforest's
<i>Histoires Tragiques</i> (<i>Hamlet</i>); Dowden thinks Shakespeare received
hints from the English version (1578) of Appian's <i>Roman Wars</i>.</p>

"Afterwards when C&aelig;sar's body was brought into the market-place,
Antonius making his funeral oration in praise of the dead,
according to the ancient custom of Rome, and perceiving that his
words moved the common people to compassion, he framed his eloquence
to make their hearts yearn the more; and taking C&aelig;sar's
gown all bloody in his hand, he laid it open to the sight of them all,
shewing what a number of cuts and holes it had upon it. Therewithal
the people fell presently into such a rage and mutiny, that
there was no more order kept amongst the common people."&mdash;Plutarch,

C&aelig;sar's campaigns in Gaul put vast sums of money into his
hands, a large part of which he kept to his own use, as he might
have kept it all; but he did also, in fact, make over much of it to
the public treasury. This was a very popular act, as it lightened the
taxation of the city.</p>

These repetitions of 'honourable man' are intensely ironical;
and for that very reason the irony should be studiously kept out of
the voice in pronouncing them. Speakers and readers utterly spoil
the effect of the speech by specially emphasizing the irony. For,
from the extreme delicacy of his position, Antony is obliged to proceed
with the utmost caution, until he gets the audience thoroughly
in his power. The consummate adroitness which he uses to this end
is one of the greatest charms of this oration.</p>

This is the artfullest and most telling stroke in Antony's
speech. The Romans prided themselves most of all upon their
military virtue and renown: C&aelig;sar was their greatest military hero;
and his victory over the Nervii was his most noted military exploit.
It occurred during his second campaign in Gaul, in the summer of
the year <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> 57, and is narrated with surpassing vividness in the
second book of his <i>Gallic War</i>. Plutarch, in his <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, gives
graphic details of this famous victory and the effect upon the Roman
people of the news of C&aelig;sar's personal prowess, when "flying in
amongst the barbarous people," he "made a lane through them
that fought before him." Of course the matter about the 'mantle'
is purely fictitious: C&aelig;sar had on the civic gown, not the military
cloak, when killed; and it was, in fact, the mangled toga that Antony
displayed on this occasion; but the fiction has the effect of making
the allusion to the victory seem perfectly artless and incidental.</p>

be a printer's slip but used in the sense of a 'penned or premeditated

"For first of all, when C&aelig;sar's testament was openly read
among them, whereby it appeared that he bequeathed unto every
citizen of Rome seventy-five drachmas a man; and that he left his
gardens and arbors unto the people, which he had on this side of
the river Tiber, in the place where now the temple of Fortune is
built: the people then loved him, and were marvellous sorry for
him."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_153" id="noteIII_153" href="#tagIII_153">III.153</a>
The drachma (lit. 'what can be grasped in the hand') was
the principal silver coin of the ancient Greeks, and while the nominal
value of it was about that of the modern drachma (by law of the same
value as the French franc) its purchasing power was much greater.
C&aelig;sar left to each citizen three hundred sesterces; Plutarch gives
seventy-five drachmas as the Greek equivalent.</p>

<p><a name="noteIII_154" id="noteIII_154" href="#tagIII_154">III.154</a>
As this scene lies in the Forum, near the Capitol, C&aelig;sar's
gardens are, in fact, on the other side of the Tiber. But Shakespeare
wrote as he read in Plutarch. See quotation, p. 111, l. 239.</p>

"Therewithal the people fell presently into such a rage and
mutiny, that there was no more order kept amongst the common
people. For some of them cried out 'Kill the murderers'; others
plucked up forms, tables, and stalls about the market-place, as they
had done before at the funerals of Clodius, and having laid them all
on a heap together, they set them on fire, and thereupon did put the
body of C&aelig;sar, and burnt it in the midst of the most holy places.
When the fire was throughly kindled, some took burning firebrands,
and ran with them to the murderers' houses that killed him, to set
them on fire."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

Nowhere in literature is there a
more realistic study and interpretation of the temper of a mob (a word

"There was one of C&aelig;sar's friends called Cinna, that had a
marvellous strange and terrible dream the night before. He dreamed
that C&aelig;sar bad him to supper, and that he refused and would not
go: then that C&aelig;sar took him by the hand, and led him against his
will. Now Cinna, hearing at that time that they burnt C&aelig;sar's body
in the market-place, notwithstanding that he feared his dream, and
had an ague on him besides, he went into the market-place to honour
his funerals. When he came thither, one of the mean sort asked
him what his name was? He was straight called by his name. The
first man told it to another, and that other unto another, so that it
ran straight through them all, that he was one of them that murthered
C&aelig;sar: (for indeed one of the traitors to C&aelig;sar was also called
Cinna as himself) wherefore taking him for Cinna the murtherer,
they fell upon him with such fury that they presently dispatched
him in the market-place."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>

<span class="smallcaps">Scene I.</span> The Folios give no indication of place, but that Shakespeare
intended the scene to be in Rome is clear from ll. 10, 11,
where Lepidus is sent to C&aelig;sar's house and told that he will find
his confederates "or here, or at the Capitol." In fact, however, the
triumvirs, Octavius, Antonius, and Lepidus, met in November, <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span> 43,
some nineteen months after the assassination of C&aelig;sar, on a small
island in the river Rhenus (now the Reno), near Bononia (Bologna).
"All three met together in an island environed round about with a
little river, and there remained three days together. Now, as touching
all other matters they were easily agreed, and did divide all the
empire of Rome between them, as if it had been their own inheritance.
But yet they could hardly agree whom they would put to
death: for every one of them would kill their enemies, and save
their kinsmen and friends. Yet, at length, giving place to their
greedy desire to be revenged of their enemies, they spurned all reverence
of blood and holiness of friendship at their feet. For C&aelig;sar
left Cicero to Antonius's will; Antonius also forsook Lucius C&aelig;sar,
who was his uncle by his mother; and both of them together suffered
Lepidus to kill his own brother Paulus. Yet some writers
affirm that C&aelig;sar and Antonius requested Paulus might be slain, and
that Lepidus was contented with it."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Antonius</i>.</p>

ll. 37-39 As the textual notes show, modern editors have not been
content with the reading of the Folios. The serious trouble with the
old text is the period at the close of l. 37. If a comma be substituted
the meaning becomes obvious: Lepidus is one who is always interested
in, and talking about, such things&mdash;books, works of art, etc.&mdash;as
everybody else has got tired of and thrown aside. Cf. Falstaff's
account of Shallow, <i>2 Henry IV</i>, III, ii, 340: "'a came ever in the
rearward of the fashion; and sung those tunes to the over-scutch'd
huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were
his fancies or his good-nights." 'Stal'd' is 'outworn,' or 'grown
stale'; and the reference is not to objects, etc., generally, but only
to those which have lost the interest of freshness. 'Abjects' in
the Staunton-Cambridge reading, is 'things thrown away'; 'orts,'
'broken fragments.'</p>

<p>Employs me as a property, and, grown useless,</p>

Hudson's Shakespeare, would give as the meaning of the line,

abused their trust, prostituting it to the ends of private gain.</p>

<p><a name="noteIV_41" id="noteIV_41" href="#tagIV_41">IV.41</a>
ll. 50, 52 In previous editions of Hudson's Shakespeare was adopted
Craik's suggestion that in these lines, as they stand in the Folios, the
names Lucius and Lucilius got shuffled each into the other's place;
and then, to cure the metrical defect in the third line, that line was
made to begin with 'Let.' Craik speaks of "the absurdity of such
an association as Lucius and Titinius for the guarding of the door."
In Porter and Clarke's 'First Folio,' <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, the answer to this
criticism is: "But a greater absurdity is involved in sending the
page with an order to the lieutenant commander of the army, and
the extra length of l. 50 pairs with a like extra length in l. 51.
Lucilius, having been relieved by Lucius, after giving the order
returns and guards the door again."</p>

"Now as it commonly happened in great affairs between two
persons, both of them having many friends and so many captains
under them, there ran tales and complaints between them. Therefore,
before they fell in hand with any other matter they went into
a little chamber together, and bade every man avoid, and did shut
the doors to them. Then they began to pour out their complaints
one to the other, and grew hot and loud, earnestly accusing one
another, and at length both fell a-weeping. Their friends that were
without the chamber, hearing them loud within, and angry between
themselves, they were both amazed and afraid also, lest it would
grow to further matter: but yet they were commanded that no man
should come to them."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

"Now Cassius would have done Brutus much honour, as
Brutus did unto him, but Brutus most commonly prevented him,
and went first unto him, both because he was the elder man as also
for that he was sickly of body. And men reputed him commonly to
be very skilful in wars, but otherwise marvellous choleric and cruel,
who sought to rule men by fear rather than with lenity: and on the

ll. 51-54 This mistake of Brutus is well conceived. Cassius was much
the abler soldier, and Brutus knew it; and the mistake grew from
his consciousness of the truth of what he thought he heard. Cassius
had served as qu&aelig;stor under Marcus Crassus in his expedition against
the Parthians; and, when the army was torn all to pieces, both Crassus
and his son being killed, Cassius displayed great ability in bringing off
a remnant. He showed remarkable military power, too, in Syria.</p>

<b>rascal counters:</b>
worthless money. 'Rascal' is properly a technical term for a deer

'Counters' were disks of metal, of very small intrinsic value, much
used for reckoning. Cf. <i>As You Like It</i>, II, vii, 63; <i>The Winter's
Tale</i>, IV, iii, 38. Professor Dowden comments aptly on what
we have here: "Brutus loves virtue and despises gold; but in the logic
of facts there is an irony cruel or pathetic. Brutus maintains a lofty
position of immaculate honour above Cassius; but ideals, and a
heroic contempt for gold, will not fill the military coffer, or pay
the legions, and the poetry of noble sentiment suddenly drops down to
the prosaic complaint that Cassius had denied the demands made
by Brutus for certain sums of money. Nor is Brutus, though he
worships an ideal of Justice, quite just in matters of practical detail."</p>

"Whilst Brutus and Cassius were together in the city of
Smyrna, Brutus prayed Cassius to let him have part of his money

request, and earnestly dissuaded him from it; persuading him, that
it was no reason that Brutus should have the money which Cassius
had gotten together by sparing, and levied with great evil will of the
people their subjects, for him to bestow liberally upon his soldiers,
and by this means to win their good wills, by Cassius's charge.
This notwithstanding, Cassius gave him the third part of this total
sum."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

"One Marcus Phaonius, that ... took upon him to
counterfeit a philosopher, not with wisdom and discretion, but with
a certain bedlam and frantic motion; he would needs come into the
chamber, though the men offered to keep him out. But it was no
boot to let Phaonius, when a mad mood or toy took him in the
head: for he was an hot hasty man, and sudden in all his doings,
and cared for never a senator of them all. Now, though he used
this bold manner of speech after the profession of the Cynic philosophers,
(as who would say, <i>Dogs</i>,) yet his boldness did no hurt many
times, because they did but laugh at him to see him so mad. This
Phaonius at that time, in spite of the door-keepers, came into the
chamber, and with a certain scoffing and mocking gesture, which he
counterfeited of purpose, he rehearsed the verses which old Nestor said
in Homer:</p>

In his philosophy, Brutus was a mixture of the Stoic and the
Platonist. What he says of Portia's death is among the best things
in the play, and is in Shakespeare's noblest style. Profound emotion
expresses itself with reserve. Deep grief loves not many words.</p>

<p><a name="noteIV_96" id="noteIV_96" href="#tagIV_96">IV.96</a>
Strict harmony of construction would require 'impatience'
for 'impatient' here, or 'griev'd' for 'grief' in the next line. Shakespeare
is not very particular in such niceties. Besides, the broken
construction expresses dramatically the deep emotion of the speaker.</p>

It appears something uncertain whether Portia's death was
before or after her husband's. Plutarch represents it as occurring
before; but Merivale follows those who place it after. "For Portia,
Brutus's wife, Nicolaus the philosopher and Valerius Maximus do
write, that she determining to kill herself (her parents and friends
carefully looking to her to keep her from it) took hot burning coals,
and cast them into her mouth, and kept her mouth so close that she
choked herself. There was a letter of Brutus found, written to his
friends, complaining of their negligence, that, his wife being sick,
they would not help her, but suffered her to kill herself, choosing to
die rather than to languish in pain."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

"These three, Octavius C&aelig;sar, Antonius, and Lepidus, made
an agreement between themselves, and by those articles divided the
provinces belonging to the empire of Rome among themselves, and

that Brutus's friends at Rome did not write to him directly of Portia's
death, as they feared the news might unnerve him, but wrote to some
common friends in the army, directing them to break the news to
him, as they should deem it safe and prudent to do so.</p>

as occurring at Philippi just before the battle: "Cassius was of opinion
not to try this war at one battle, but rather to delay time, and to draw
it out in length, considering that they were the stronger in money, and
the weaker in men and armour. But Brutus, in contrary manner, did
alway before, and at that time also, desire nothing more than to put
all to the hazard of battle, as soon as might be possible; to the end
he might either quickly restore his country to her former liberty, or
rid him forthwith of this miserable world."&mdash;<i>Marcus Brutus.</i></p>

ll. 252-253 These two simple lines, with the answer of Lucius, "I
was sure your lordship did not give it me," are among the best
things in the play. Consider how much is implied in them, and
what a picture they give of the earnest, thoughtful, book-loving
Brutus. And indeed all his noblest traits of character come out,
"in simple and pure soul," in this exquisite scene with Lucius,
which is hardly surpassed by anything in Shakespeare. Who could
be troubled by the anachronism in the book being of modern shape?
"Brutus was a careful man, and slept very little, both for that his
diet was moderate, as also because he was continually occupied.
He never slept in the day-time, and in the night no longer than the
time he was driven to be alone, and when everybody else took their
rest. But now whilst he was in war, and his head ever busily occupied
to think of his affairs and what would happen, after he had
slumbered a little after supper, he spent all the rest of the night in
dispatching of his weightiest causes, and after he had taken order
for them, if he had any leisure left him, he would read some book till
the third watch of the night, at what time the captains, petty captains,
and colonels, did use to come to him."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

The presence of a ghost was believed to make lights burn
blue or dimly. So in <i>Richard III</i>, V, iii, 180, when the ghosts appear
to Richard, he says: "The lights burn blue. It is now dead

<b>this monstrous apparition.</b> "Above all, the ghost that appeared
unto Brutus shewed plainly that the gods were offended with the
murder of C&aelig;sar. The vision was thus: Brutus ... thought he
heard a noise at his tent-door, and, looking towards the light of the
lamp that waxed very dim, he saw a horrible vision of a man, of a
wonderful greatness and dreadful look, which at the first made him
marvellously afraid. But when he saw that it did no hurt, but stood
at his bedside and said nothing; at length he asked him what he
was. The image answered him: 'I am thy ill angel, Brutus, and
thou shalt see me by the city of Philippes.' Then Brutus replied
again, and said, 'Well, I shall see thee then.' Therewithal the
spirit presently vanished from him."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>

This strongly, though quietly, marks the Ghost as subjective;
as soon as Brutus recovers his firmness, the illusion is broken. The
order of things is highly judicious here, in bringing the "horrible
vision" upon Brutus just after he has heard of Portia's shocking
death. With that great sorrow weighing upon him, he might well
see ghosts. The thickening of calamities upon him, growing out of
the assassination of C&aelig;sar, naturally awakens remorse.</p>

Plutarch tells that Cassius, though the more experienced
soldier, allowed Brutus to lead the right wing. "Shakespeare made
use of this incident, but transferred to the opposite camp, in order
to bring out the character of Octavius which made Antony yield.
Octavius really commanded the left wing."&mdash;Clar.</p>

<b>I will do so:</b> I will do as I have said. Not 'I will cross you.'
At this time Octavius was but twenty-one years old, and Antony was
old enough to be his father. At the time of C&aelig;sar's death, when
Octavius was in his nineteenth year, Antony thought he was going to
manage him easily and have it all his own way with him; but he found
the youngster as stiff as a crowbar, and could do nothing with him.
C&aelig;sar's youngest sister, Julia, was married to Marcus Atius Balbus,
and their daughter Atia, again, was married to Caius Octavius, a
nobleman of the plebeian order. From this marriage sprang the
present Octavius, who afterwards became the Emperor Augustus.
He was mainly educated by his great-uncle, was advanced to the
patrician order, and was adopted as his son and heir; so that his
full and proper designation at this time was Caius Julius C&aelig;sar
Octavianus. The text gives a right taste of the man, who always
stood firm as a post against Antony, till the latter finally knocked
himself to pieces against him.</p>

<b>prevent The time:</b> anticipate the full, natural period. To
the understanding of this speech, it must be observed that the sense
of the words, 'arming myself,' etc., follows next after the words,
'which he did give himself.' In this passage, as Dr. Wright (Clar.)
has pointed out, Shakespeare was misled by an error in North's
version of Amyot's Plutarch, where we have <i>feis</i> (= <i>fis</i>) translated
as if it were from <i>fier</i>: "Brutus answered him, being yet but a young
man, and not over greatly experienced in the world; 'I trust (I know
not how) a certain rule of philosophy, by the which I did greatly
blame ... Cato for killing himself, as being no lawful nor godly act,
touching the gods; nor, concerning men, valiant: but, being now in
the midst of the danger, I am of a contrary mind.'"&mdash;Plutarch,
<i>Marcus Brutus</i>. Wright, in his note on this passage, shows how the
true meaning is obscured by bad printing and punctuation. Brutus's
answer begins really with, 'Being yet but a young man'; and 'I trust'
is evidently a past tense (Old English 'truste') which must have
been read by Shakespeare as the present.</p>

"The philosopher indeed renounced all confidence in his
own principles. He had adopted them from reading or imitation;
they were not the natural growth of instinct or genuine reflection;
and, as may easily happen in such a case, his faith in them failed
when they were tested by adversity. As long as there seemed a
chance that the godlike stroke would be justified by success, Brutus
claimed the glory of maintaining a righteous cause; but, when all
hope fled, he could take leave of philosophy and life together, and
exclaim, 'I once dreamed that virtue was a thing; I find her only a
name, and the mere slave of fortune.' He had blamed Cato for flying
from misery by self-murder; but he learnt to justify the same desperate
act when he contemplated committing it himself."&mdash;Merivale.</p>

Brutus wants Cassius to attack the enemy at the same time that he
himself does. In the next scene, Messala and his escort are met by

It was a dagger, not a sword, that Cassius stabbed C&aelig;sar with.
But by a common figure of speech the same weapon is put for the same
owner.  The 'sword' is taken from Plutarch. "For he, being overcome
in battle at the journey of Philippes, slew himself with the same sword
with the which he strake C&aelig;sar."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>.</p>

"Cassius, thinking indeed that Titinius was taken of the
enemies, he then spake these words: 'Desiring too much to live,
I have lived to see one of my best friends taken, for my sake, before
my face.' After that, he got into a tent where nobody was, and took
Pindarus with him, one of his bondsmen whom he reserved ever for
such a pinch, since the cursed battle of the Parthians, where Crassus
was slain, though he notwithstanding scaped from that overthrow:
but then, casting his cloak over his head, and holding out his bare
neck unto Pindarus, he gave him his head to be stricken off. So
the head was found severed from the body; but after that time
Pindarus was never seen more."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

ll. 94-96 Brutus here strikes again, full and strong, the proper keynote
of the play. The facts involved are well stated by Froude:
"The murderers of C&aelig;sar, and those who had either instigated them
secretly or applauded them afterwards, were included in a proscription
list, drawn by retributive justice on the model of Sulla's. Such of
them as were in Italy were immediately killed. Those in the provinces,
as if with the curse of Cain upon their heads, came one by
one to miserable ends. In three years the tyrannicides of the Ides of
March, with their aiders and abettors, were all dead; some killed in
battle, some in prison, some dying by their own hand."</p>

"There was one of Brutus' friends called Lucilius, who seeing
a troop of barbarous men making no reckoning of all men else they
met in their way, but going all together right against Brutus, he determined
to stay them with the hazard of his life; and being left behind,
told them that he was Brutus: and because they should believe him,
he prayed them to bring him to Antonius, for he said he was afraid
of C&aelig;sar, and that he did trust Antonius better. These barbarous
men, being very glad of this good hap, and thinking themselves
happy men, they carried him in the night, and sent some before unto
Antonius, to tell him of their coming. He was marvellous glad of it
and went out to meet them that brought him.... When they
came near together, Antonius stayed awhile bethinking himself how
he should use Brutus. In the meantime Lucilius was brought to
him, who stoutly with a bold countenance said: 'Antonius, I dare
assure thee, that no enemy hath taken or shall take Marcus Brutus
alive, and I beseech God keep him from that fortune: for wheresoever
ever he be found, alive or dead, he will be found like himself. And
now for myself, I am come unto thee, having deceived these men of
arms here, bearing them down that I was Brutus, and do not refuse
to suffer any torment thou wilt put me to.'... Antonius on the
other side, looking upon all them that had brought him, said unto
them: 'My companions, I think ye are sorry you have failed of
your purpose, and that you think this man hath done you great
wrong: but I assure you, you have taken a better booty than that
you followed. For instead of an enemy you have brought me a
friend: and for my part, if you had brought me Brutus alive, truly I
cannot tell what I should have done to him. For I had rather have
such men my friends, as this man here, than mine enemies.' Then
he embraced Lucilius, and at that time delivered him to one of his
friends in custody; and Lucilius ever after served him faithfully,
even to his death."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

"Brutus thought that there was no great number of men slain
in battle; and, to know the truth of it, there was one called Statilius
that promised to go through his enemies, for otherwise it was impossible
to go see their camp; and from thence, if all were well, that
he would lift up a torch-light in the air, and then return again with
speed to him. The torch-light was lift up as he had promised, for
Statilius went thither. Now, Brutus seeing Statilius tarry long after
that, and that he came not again, he said, 'If Statilius be alive, he
will come again.' But his evil fortune was such that, as he came
back, he lighted in his enemies' hands and was slain. Now the night
being far spent, Brutus as he sat bowed towards Clitus, one of his
men, and told him somewhat in his ear: the other answered him
not, but fell a-weeping. Thereupon he proved<a class="tag" name="tagV_111_1" id="tagV_111_1" href="#noteV_111_1">[1]</a> Dardanus, and said

fighting could not be slain."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>. Merivale
has a strong sentence on this: "The legend that when preparing
for the encounter with the triumvirs he was visited by the ghost of
C&aelig;sar, which summoned him to meet again at Philippi, marks the
conviction of the ancients that in the crisis of his fate he was
stung by guilty remorse, and haunted by the presentiment of final
retribution."</p>

"Amongst the rest, one of them said, there was no tarrying for
them there, but that they must needs fly. Then Brutus, rising up, 'We
must fly indeed,' said he, 'but it must be with our hands, not with
our feet.' Then, taking every man by the hand, he said these words
unto them with a cheerful countenance: 'It rejoiceth my heart, that
not one of my friends hath failed me at my need, and I do not complain
of my fortune, but only for my country's sake: for, as for me,
I think myself happier than they that have overcome, considering
that I leave a perpetual fame of virtue and honesty, the which our
enemies the conquerors shall never attain unto by force or money.'
Having so said, he prayed every man to shift for himself, and then
he went a little aside with two or three only, among the which Strato
was one, with whom he came first acquainted by the study of rhetoric.
Strato, at his request, held the sword in his hand, and turned
his head aside, and Brutus fell down upon it, and so ran himself
through ... and died presently."&mdash;Plutarch, <i>Marcus Brutus</i>.</p>

This refers to the old doctrine of the four elements, earth,
water, air, and fire, a right proportion of which was supposed to be
the principle of all excellence in nature. Shakespeare has many
allusions to the doctrine, which was a commonplace of the sixteenth
century. It is this common property in the idea which invalidates the
importance of the argument for the date of <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> drawn from
a similar passage in Drayton's revised version of his <i>Mortimeriados</i>
(1596-1597) published in 1603 under the title of <i>The Barons' Wars</i>.</p>

<b>call the field to rest:</b> give the signal to cease fighting. 'Field,'
by metonymy, is occasionally used in sixteenth century literature as
synonymous with 'battle' or 'order of battle.' Cf. the expression
'to gather a field,' meaning 'to collect an armed force.' So in Hall's
<i>Chronicles</i>, 1548: "my lorde of Winchester intended to gather any
feld or assemble people." Cf., too, 'field' as a hunting term.</p>

<b>part:</b> distribute. A specific meaning of 'part' used to be
'share one with another.' This sense is now obsolete or provincial.</p>
